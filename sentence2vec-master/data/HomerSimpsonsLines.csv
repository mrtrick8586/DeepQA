1,Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
2,"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
3,Oh.
4,And?
5,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
6,Me?
7,I don't think you realize what you're saying.
8,"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
9,Go Away.
10,"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
11,Nuts.
12,This isn't going well at all.
13,"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
14,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
15,Oh.
16,"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
17,I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
18,Gimme a banana.
19,"Come on, you're holding out on me."
20,Think nothing of it.
21,"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
22,"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
23,Would you have to do extra work?
24,"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
25,"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
26,Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
27,Uh oh.
28,"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
29,"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
30,Mmm... hors doovers.
31,I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
32,"Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
33,"Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah."
34,How do I look?
35,Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
36,What are all our friends names again?
37,Why not? I paid for it.
38,"Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
39,Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
40,No.
41,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?"
42,It was me! You fell for it!
43,You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
44,Bart! Come over here.
45,"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
46,"Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
47,That thing you know how to do.
48,Go to bed.
49,"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
50,"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
51,You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
52,All right then.
53,Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
54,Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
55,Why? What'd you do?
56,Marge!
57,Where-where are we going?
58,The way I acted?
59,So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
60,I put it there.
61,I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
62,"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church."
63,"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
64,About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
65,I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
66,Aw.
67,"Marge, Marge."
68,"Sorry, Reverend."
69,Hmmmm.
70,"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea."
71,Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
72,"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!"
73,They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
74,"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth."
75,"No, you don't!"
76,"Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk."
77,"Hmmm, bait."
78,"Whoa, better get some gas."
79,Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
80,Catfish Lake.
81,"Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?"
82,Oh yeah.
83,"Whoa, who says that?"
84,Oh.
85,Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
86,"None of your business, Flanders."
87,Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
88,Oh.
89,I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
90,Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
91,"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
92,She's perfect.
93,"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
94,I'm done.
95,It's true. It's all true.
96,Sorry.
97,I only did that a couple of times.
98,"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime."
99,Would this be a good time to be honest?
100,"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
101,No.
102,All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
103,Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
104,"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!"
105,"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
106,Good! Give up!
107,Huh?
108,"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
109,Whoa! Holy mackerel!
110,"I love you, but I must kill you."
111,I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
112,"Uh, oh."
113,"Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?"
114,"Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero."
115,To those weirdos in the worm store.
116,"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
117,Watch.
118,"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby."
119,We're back!
120,Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
121,I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.
122,"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!"
123,"All right, what are you getting at?"
124,"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
125,"Well, t.s."
126,No.
127,No.
128,No.
129,No.
130,No.
131,No.
132,No.
133,"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
134,Are you?
135,Are you?
136,Are you?
137,Are you?
138,Are you?
139,Are you?
140,Are you?
141,Are you?
142,Are you?
143,Are you?
144,"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!"
145,Bart! What are you staring at?
146,Bart! Stop it!
147,"Hey, what's all the --"
148,My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
149,"What's the problem, boy?"
150,"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
151,Nah.
152,"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
153,They're fine.
154,"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
155,How many hairs on my head? Without looking!
156,"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
157,"Sorry, sir."
158,Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
159,"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it."
160,Earmuffs.
161,"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
162,"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!"
163,"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
164,"Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?"
165,"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
166,It was the olden days!
167,"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!"
168,Now let's get the show on the road.
169,Eh.... the boy.
170,Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
171,"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!"
172,Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
173,"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
174,"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
175,"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
176,"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
177,"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
178,"Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
179,Bart!
180,"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter."
181,"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"
182,"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
183,An elephant's butt.
184,Yup!
185,"Forget it, Marge!"
186,"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works."
187,Cheap son-of-a...
188,Hmmm...
189,"Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
190,Where's the letter?
191,Where is it?
192,"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!"
193,"Bart, have you seen the letter?"
194,"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?"
195,Uh huh.
196,Yeah...
197,Why did you do that?
198,I'll show you mad in the morning.
199,"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!"
200,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
201,"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
202,"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
203,"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
204,"Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal."
205,That's a good one. We'll use that.
206,"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
207,"Well, I'm still gonna run!"
208,"Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me."
209,I don't know.
210,"Great plan, Bart."
211,"Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
212,Oops.
213,Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
214,Homer Simpson.
215,"Yeah, well I'll be on my --"
216,"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?"
217,"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
218,Me and my big... letter writing pen!
219,"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
220,"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one."
221,"Oh, woe is me."
222,"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
223,"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
224,"Marge, what does it do?"
225,"Marge! Really, what does it do?"
226,"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock."
227,"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
228,Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
229,Amen to that!
230,Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
231,"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
232,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
233,"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
234,"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
235,You! You did this to me!
236,"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
237,You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
238,Print name?
239,"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
240,"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it."
241,"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?"
242,O-kay.
243,No deal.
244,"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?"
245,Look at him!
246,Awww.
247,Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!
248,"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV."
249,Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!
250,"So, did I pass?"
251,The devil with his fly open.
252,That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.
253,Arrghh!
254,The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
255,Who are you?
256,"I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons."
257,"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
258,Doesn't ring a bell.
259,What was that last one?
260,Nope.
261,Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
262,"No, that thing with your feet."
263,Because I wore a pink shirt.
264,What'd you wear?
265,Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
266,"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me."
267,Okay. Five times nine.
268,Wowww.
269,"Hey, Chief."
270,"Gee, I gotta call my family."
271,"Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god."
272,"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
273,"That's all right, son."
274,What's that?
275,"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared."
276,Pancakes... football... Boobies...
277,Was the door locked?
278,Was it raining?
279,Were you out of gas?
280,Baby.
281,Mmm... pancakes.
282,Marge!
283,"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?"
284,Not insane.
285,"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
286,You are? Why?
287,"Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --"
288,#NAME?
289,"Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
290,Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
291,Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.
292,Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see.
293,Huh? Huh?
294,Come off. I'm sane now.
295,Not me. I got this.
296,"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"
297,Huh? A check?
298,One Million dollars? I'm rich!
299,"Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?"
300,Shut up.
301,I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
302,"Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now."
303,"Hey, a cartoon."
304,"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth."
305,"Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
306,"Nah, you go ahead."
307,"As Tolstoy said in ""Quotable Notables,"" ""Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""
308,"Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds."
309,"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
310,"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
311,Those kids don't know what they're missing.
312,We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
313,Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He'll be killed!
314,Don't be so...
315,"Oh, you're right."
316,Hmph?
317,"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""
318,"Marge, you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
319,Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!
320,"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids."
321,Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --
322,"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine."
323,YEAH! Damn right!
324,Uh-uh.
325,Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
326,"Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me."
327,We're all gonna die!
328,"Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi!"
329,BOOOOO!
330,Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!
331,"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off."
332,Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello.
333,Wake-up call? It's two AM!
334,Free food?!
335,"Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is ""How To Increase Your Word Power."" That thing is really, really, really good."
336,"Miss? What does the ""I"" stand for?"
337,"Ah! What does the ""I"" stand for again?"
338,"Yeah, right."
339,Mmmmmm... Money.
340,Lousy cheap country...
341,BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!
342,"Hey, what's so funny?"
343,"Oh Marge, grow up."
344,Who's that?
345,"Bart, are you ready to go to... I'll room service you..."
346,"Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'."
347,Gimme one of those!
348,Give her the check!
349,I was serious.
350,I'm almost done.
351,I'll be there. Not-y not-y not.
352,"Well, why doesn't he just say so?"
353,"Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story."
354,"Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place."
355,"Don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club..."
356,"Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave."
357,"What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que."
358,"Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!"
359,"Hey, no tagbacks."
360,The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
361,That was a joke?
362,Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
363,"Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?"
364,Nah.
365,"No, it isn't."
366,"Hmm, let's see."
367,Nah.
368,Hmmm.
369,Heyyyy.
370,"Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!"
371,Ooooh.
372,Mmmm -- too far.
373,Okay. Ready.
374,Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I've got more chicken bone!
375,Oooh. That would be a shame.
376,"Wouldn't it, Flanders?"
377,"Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend."
378,"See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology."
379,"Well, if it isn't the Leftorium."
380,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
381,"Hey Flanders, how's business?"
382,"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?"
383,"I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?"
384,"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know."
385,"Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
386,"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything."
387,"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
388,"Ooh, the touch of death."
389,"Hey, boy. How was class?"
390,"Oh, that'll learn 'im."
391,"Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?"
392,Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
393,"Uh, well actually, Moe..."
394,I dunno.
395,"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"
396,"Homer Simpson, sir."
397,"Can I leave, Mr. Burns?"
398,But the note was asking you to --
399,"Um, Mr. Burns..."
400,"Sorry, Flanders."
401,Huh?
402,"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?"
403,"Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!"
404,I'll give you twenty bucks for it.
405,"You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it."
406,Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!
407,Twenty dollars?
408,Now I don't want it.
409,"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
410,"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?"
411,Daddly-doodly.
412,Only seventy-five beans!
413,"Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many."
414,"I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there."
415,Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?
416,"Uh, there's a store where..."
417,Yeah.
418,"Knock 'em dead, boy! Kid's gonna be a black belt in no time."
419,"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
420,You're gonna live in your car?
421,I know!
422,Why not?
423,Oh.
424,"Oh, it's all my fault."
425,Yes it is.
426,"No, I was a swine."
427,"Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?"
428,"Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
429,I SAID DO IT!
430,"Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me."
431,"C'mon, you lefties. What'd I tell you?"
432,"It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right."
433,To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
434,"Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
435,"That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh."
436,How much does it pay?
437,Pfft. I make more than that.
438,... Bart! Have you started smoking?
439,Don't lie to me boy.
440,"Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought."
441,"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn..."
442,"Son, I'll never doubt you again."
443,"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
444,See? It was all your imagination.
445,"Oh, all right."
446,"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
447,"You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter."
448,"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
449,Kill my boy! Kill my boy!
450,"Wait till I get you home, boy."
451,"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit."
452,I thought he was dead.
453,"Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
454,"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
455,You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
456,"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate."
457,"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
458,What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.
459,Huh? Noise. Bad noise!
460,"Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it."
461,Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!
462,"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."
463,"Uh-huh. It's as fat as a phone book! ""Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 Slow Fission Reactor. Get to the point, man! Ooh, what's this?"
464,Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
465,"I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
466,Shut up!
467,"Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!"
468,"Okay, okay, think back to your training..."
469,Yes.
470,"Ooh, a side."
471,What?
472,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it."
473,"This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!"
474,"Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe."
475,"Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button."
476,Magic Johnson! Y'ello.
477,Yeah.
478,"Well, thank you."
479,"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
480,"Thanks, Magic."
481,"Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home."
482,It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!
483,"What's your problem, boy?"
484,That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.
485,What? What is it? What are you doing?
486,"Well, as long as it's quiet."
487,"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it."
488,Huh? Wha?...
489,Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
490,"But I really can't tell them anything, sir."
491,What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
492,Did it work?
493,Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...
494,"Um, Grace under pressure is no..."
495,Whew! Saved by the bell.
496,All right.
497,"Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe."
498,Sure. Moe.
499,You think it's him?
500,What are you talking about? Of course he does.
501,We could have seen a monkey.
502,He's talking funny talk.
503,A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.
504,Mel Brooks is Jewish?
505,"Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?"
506,"Yeah, Krusty, tell us."
507,"Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps."
508,Why you little...
509,"No, that's it. You've seen everything."
510,Gladly.
511,"Hey, if you don't like it, go to Russia."
512,"Hey, aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes."
513,"Here you go, kids. Lousy punks..."
514,Get a good haul this year?
515,"I am very, very proud of you kids."
516,I'd like to see that.
517,What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?
518,Eeuhgh. What is this thing?
519,Oh yeah? How much?
520,"C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!"
521,"Why at that little shop, right over... there."
522,"Oh no, wait, it was over there."
523,"Don't shoot, Don't shoot. They're souvenirs."
524,Okay.
525,"Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish."
526,"Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true."
527,"Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie."
528,Now you're talkin'!
529,Woo hoo!
530,"C'mon, everybody. We're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!"
531,"Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful."
532,"Lisa, that was very selfish of you."
533,"Ok, Ok. I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?"
534,"Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey's a little dry. The turkey's a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?!"
535,"Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh."
536,I wish I had a Monkey's Paw.
537,Hiya Bart!!! How's my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh.
538,"It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It's real good."
539,"He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side."
540,Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.
541,Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks.
542,"Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh."
543,I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.
544,Ouch!
545,"Good night, son."
546,"Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back."
547,"Oh, ah, thanks boy."
548,"I love you, son."
549,You both toilet-trained?
550,"Well, okay then... ... Four o'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work."
551,Huh? What?
552,For what?
553,How do you know I was sleeping?
554,Camera?
555,How hard can it be?
556,"Ooo, what job is that?"
557,Sheesh. What a slave driver.
558,No. Bart bit me.
559,I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
560,I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!
561,Umm. Spaghetti.
562,"Oh, I hate having two heads."
563,Oooh.
564,Ahhh.
565,Y'ello.
566,"Don't worry, I know it's tonight."
567,Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
568,"Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed."
569,"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
570,"Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes."
571,"Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?"
572,"You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
573,Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.
574,The moron next door closed early!
575,"Oh, me and my trenchant mouth."
576,"Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it!"
577,"Please, you've got to open that store."
578,"Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one."
579,"I'll have you know, I wrote it down."
580,Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
581,Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!
582,I dunno.
583,No.
584,No.
585,No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?
586,"Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father."
587,Uh-oh.
588,Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!
589,I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
590,That cost eighty-eight dollars!
591,"Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
592,You didn't mean that!
593,No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive.
594,Okay.
595,"Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie."
596,"Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for."
597,"Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony."
598,"Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore."
599,"See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes."
600,"Ha ha, you love me."
601,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
602,Mm.
603,Buh.
604,Sneh.
605,"Excuse me, do you sell ponies?"
606,"""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog!"
607,"Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs."
608,Half a million dollars?!
609,Wow!
610,I'll take it!
611,"Uh, sure... let me write you a check."
612,Is there a problem with that?
613,Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
614,I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
615,"Mr. Burns, you do this personally?"
616,U-su-ry?
617,I want to buy a pony.
618,No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
619,Sorry.
620,Of course.
621,"Simpson, you've done it again."
622,Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
623,Because she stopped loving me.
624,I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.
625,I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
626,"That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me."
627,Stable? That sounds expensive.
628,This is what love costs a month?
629,Oh nuts.
630,I was hoping it'd be money.
631,"Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
632,"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
633,"First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind."
634,"Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays."
635,"Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it."
636,Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
637,Need money. Need money.
638,"One Scratch-for-Cash, please."
639,"Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu."
640,Thank you.
641,There it is.
642,No.
643,No! No!
644,No! You can't see... come on!
645,No!
646,Let go. You're ripping it.
647,Ohh... I need money.
648,You're looking for help?
649,I'm your man!
650,Woo-hoo!
651,...Badge of honor.
652,But I eat... Oh.
653,"Heh heh, the perfect crime."
654,"Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it."
655,"I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
656,Mmm... salty.
657,No sir.
658,Yes sir.
659,I don't know. How long do horses live?
660,Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
661,Y'ello.
662,Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?
663,Going for... eight hour walk.
664,Homer sleep now.
665,"Coming right up, sir."
666,"Yes, sir."
667,"Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money..."
668,You did?
669,"Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!"
670,Awww.
671,Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!
672,That baby changed our lives.
673,Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
674,In the garage.
675,"Yeah, give us a break, Doctor."
676,"If stuff starts flying, just turn your head."
677,"Okay, okay, calm down."
678,"Okay, I will. I will."
679,"Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise."
680,"... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah."
681,Shh! They'll hear you.
682,I don't know. Some guy I guess.
683,"Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- Did you hear that?"
684,How much?
685,"What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?"
686,Anything for my little girl.
687,Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.
688,"Ooooooh, McBain."
689,Why? I just saw the best part.
690,"Oooh, ""Death by Knockout,"" ""Blood on the Ice"" Oh, oh... ""Football's Greatest Injuries"". Lisa, we're going."
691,Just grab something. All these movies are great.
692,"Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman."
693,Oh Marge.
694,"Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets."
695,Okay. Hank.
696,Hank... Jones.
697,Steve McQueen.
698,Next.
699,"Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord."
700,Then he has no hobbies.
701,Bart!... BART!!!
702,"You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
703,"Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?"
704,"Oh, that's a hobby!"
705,"Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!"
706,I'm also fat!
707,I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.
708,"Goodbye, son."
709,"Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold."
710,"Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?"
711,Huh?
712,"Oh, how I envy you!"
713,I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
714,What boy?
715,"Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer."
716,Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
717,"Okay. No, I'm gonna do it."
718,But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
719,"What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you."
720,Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
721,"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
722,"Oh, that sounds too complicated."
723,"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you."
724,"Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!"
725,"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
726,"I like our chances, son."
727,This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!
728,"Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
729,Are you nervous son?
730,"Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
731,"Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson."
732,When did I ever teach you that?
733,"Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad."
734,"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."
735,Ow.
736,Why? What's wrong?
737,"Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?"
738,"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!"
739,No!
740,"I'm not pouting, you are."
741,Sorry.
742,No. Can't think of a thing.
743,Leave me alone.
744,"Name your son's hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""..."
745,Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!
746,"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
747,Shut up Flanders. Flanders!
748,"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
749,"Great, thanks."
750,"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!"
751,"Do it for your old man, boy!"
752,"No, son, you earned it."
753,"That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
754,"Wow, infotainment."
755,He's not so fat.
756,"Bart, why are you still up?"
757,"Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego."
758,"What is it, boy?"
759,"Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man."
760,"Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?"
761,"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh."
762,Run for it boy!
763,That's it. I'm outta here.
764,"What's the matter, Moe?"
765,"Yeah, things are tough all over."
766,Could I get a beer?
767,"Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself..."
768,One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.
769,"As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink."
770,"Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?"
771,I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
772,In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
773,It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
774,"I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good."
775,"A ""Flaming Homer""."
776,"Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?"
777,Try lighting it on fire.
778,"Well, it's called a ""Flaming..."
779,"Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
780,Why yes I --
781,I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
782,Take that off this second!
783,"Nah... Marge, I'm too upset to eat -- I think I'll go to Moe's. ."
784,I need to talk to Moe.
785,I didn't even tell you my name.
786,Homer Simpson.
787,But--
788,Barney?
789,You're my kid's teacher!
790,No!
791,Get away from me.
792,"Hey, Moe?"
793,"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer""."
794,"How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it."
795,"If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
796,"Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!"
797,"I said, you just lost yourself a customer!"
798,You just lost yourself a customer.
799,"You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!"
800,You just lost yourself a customer.
801,You just lost yourself a customer.
802,"Ah, my new watering hole."
803,A beer?
804,Can I have a clean glass?
805,Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...
806,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
807,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
808,Moe... Moe... Moe...
809,Moe... Moe... Moe.
810,"Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe..."
811,"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is..."
812,"Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!"
813,"Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?"
814,"Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
815,I guess so.
816,"Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have."
817,"Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?"
818,"Oh, what do they want!"
819,It's not fair!
820,Uh-huh.
821,"Ooh, that's a lot of money."
822,"Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar?"
823,Homer Simpson here.
824,I own stock?
825,"So uh, how much did it go up?"
826,Yeah...
827,Sure...
828,Not any more...
829,That'd be great.
830,Well... how are you?
831,Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?
832,What should I do?
833,Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
834,"Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer..."
835,"No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve."
836,"For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy."
837,"Have a Duff, boys!"
838,"Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?"
839,"Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
840,Hey... hey!
841,You heard?
842,"Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too."
843,I spent it on beer.
844,Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?
845,What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
846,Ow!
847,Did you buy this car with your stock money?
848,We could all lose our jobs.
849,"Well, they can't fire me."
850,Cuz... I...
851,Lucky drunks.
852,"Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!"
853,"Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany?"
854,"Good, good, I'm learning."
855,Because we send them money?
856,"Oh, woa is me."
857,"Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it."
858,"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing."
859,"Ooh, Battlestar Galactica."
860,"Fit, damn you! Fit!"
861,There.
862,Huh? What?
863,"Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up!"
864,No.
865,No!
866,Auugghh!
867,Uh... all of them?
868,I sure do!
869,"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
870,Mmm. The land of chocolate...
871,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
872,La la la la la...
873,La la la la la la...
874,"Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate?"
875,I think I did pretty good in there.
876,"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing."
877,No problems here.
878,"I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!"
879,That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
880,Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
881,"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"
882,"And does it ever say, ""I love you?"""
883,"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!"
884,Nobody loves you...
885,Na na na na / Na na na na /
886,Woo-hoo! I got my job back!
887,"But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe."
888,"Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?"
889,"Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?"
890,"Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get."
891,"No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg."
892,Maybe.
893,"Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings."
894,"Yeah, but I have to hear about it."
895,"Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
896,"Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!"
897,For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
898,"Yes, sir."
899,"I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future..."
900,"Hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!"
901,"Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh..."
902,Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.
903,Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
904,You mean like will apes be our masters?
905,But it gives me time to think.
906,"Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!"
907,"Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father."
908,"Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda."
909,I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
910,"Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad."
911,Someday I'll buy you a real castle.
912,"Phew, good."
913,Really? It must be the Champale talking.
914,Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
915,Pass the cookie dough.
916,"Y'ello... Oh, hi Marge..."
917,Why? What's wrong?
918,Oh.
919,... ...
920,Because it's the honorable thing to do?
921,"Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
922,"Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?"
923,"Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
924,What's it say?
925,That's the card. Give it here.
926,So... will you marry me?
927,"Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo!"
928,"You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
929,"Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy."
930,They'll call him Screwy Louie.
931,Slob.
932,Puke.
933,Mucous.
934,"Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!"
935,I don't know.
936,"Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."
937,Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.
938,"Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place."
939,I am?
940,Homer.
941,I do.
942,Our first night together as man and wife.
943,"Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor."
944,Baby to Marge. Baby to Marge. Wah! Wah! Over.
945,"Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well."
946,Pfft. Now you tell me.
947,"Dear Marge, XXX. Homer."
948,Well... It takes me a long time to learn anything... I'm kind of a goof-off...
949,... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.
950,There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!
951,"Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life."
952,"Wow! Kid, I won't let you down."
953,"I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job."
954,"... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold."
955,Oh!
956,"Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co."
957,"Handle first, handle first..."
958,I quit! I quit!
959,Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first!
960,"I don't know, I don't know --"
961,"""Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."""
962,I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.
963,"Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
964,Okay.
965,Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes...
966,They get donuts?
967,Wowww.
968,"Yeah, what do you want?"
969,You want fries with that?
970,Marge?
971,Marge!
972,"Holy cow, you're as big as a house."
973,"No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
974,"Marge, for you."
975,"Oh, sure."
976,Because I knocked you up?
977,You the boss?
978,Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
979,"Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!"
980,You mean?
981,I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!
982,Marge!... Marge!...
983,The hospital?
984,"Thanks, mom."
985,"Marge! Marge, where's the baby?"
986,Shut up!
987,"No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!"
988,"Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!"
989,"And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!"
990,"Eh, somebody'll cover for me."
991,"Oh, college boy, eh?"
992,"Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."
993,"Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel."
994,Why you little... He did that on purpose!
995,"Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute..."
996,"Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have."
997,"As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more."
998,And not a day goes by that we don't thank God for all three of you.
999,"Yeah!!! Whoa! Excellent, Marge!"
1000,"Aw, ain't that cute... Hey!"
1001,Hey! Where in God's name did you learn that kind of... daaaanncciinng!
1002,Mon-ey.
1003,"Oh, sorry."
1004,That could be Bart!
1005,He's in for some lovin'.
1006,Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up.
1007,Limited?!
1008,Do you have any of those microphones left?
1009,"Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet."
1010,"Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!"
1011,There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.
1012,"Hey boy, how's the microphone working?"
1013,Bart! I would love to get a present like that.
1014,"Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch."
1015,WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY
1016,"Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!"
1017,Mmmmm. Chocolate.
1018,Mmmmm. Chocolate.
1019,"Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream."
1020,Mmmmm. Chocolate.
1021,"Why, you little..."
1022,Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present?
1023,Aww...
1024,Just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
1025,"Hey, what's up?"
1026,"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero."
1027,"Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
1028,"Well, it's more than you did!"
1029,You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
1030,"Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll..."
1031,"Hey, don't make me come down there!"
1032,"Why, you little --"
1033,"It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident."
1034,"Uh, could you edit that last part out?"
1035,"Don't worry, you'll grow into it."
1036,"That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself."
1037,"Shh! Marge, he's a good digger."
1038,"Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again."
1039,"Well, bye-bye belt."
1040,"Pfft, my heart is just fine."
1041,A little beer will put out that fire.
1042,"Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!"
1043,"Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver."
1044,Twenty big ones on Denver.
1045,"All right, Denver. Justify my love."
1046,"Lousy, stupid Denver."
1047,Why did you do that?
1048,"Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."
1049,Over.
1050,Over... over... over...
1051,"Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer."
1052,Why didn't you say that before!
1053,"Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy."
1054,"Huh, they both make a good case."
1055,Yeah!
1056,Line...
1057,"Yeah, lay it on me, coach."
1058,Mm-hm.
1059,Cincinnati...
1060,Cincinnati.
1061,Cincinnati.
1062,"C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?"
1063,"Doh, not the wind."
1064,Oh...
1065,... miles per hour.
1066,"Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?"
1067,"Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins."
1068,"All right, Dolphins!"
1069,Whoo-hoo!
1070,Fifty big ones!
1071,"Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game."
1072,"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting."
1073,"Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?"
1074,And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...
1075,"That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."
1076,YEAH!
1077,"You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible."
1078,"Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?"
1079,You bet.
1080,"Me too, honey."
1081,Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
1082,All right!
1083,What? Didn't you hear what he said?
1084,You think we should bet against them?
1085,You got it.
1086,"Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York."
1087,"Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?"
1088,"My daughter, that's who!"
1089,"Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift."
1090,"Oh, my little girl says the cutest things."
1091,Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.
1092,"The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills."
1093,I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.
1094,Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.
1095,"Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer."
1096,"Oh, violin guy!"
1097,"What's your favorite song, Lisa?"
1098,Play on.
1099,"Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks."
1100,You promised you wouldn't get mad!
1101,"Good, good... You call Moe."
1102,"Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?"
1103,Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.
1104,"Boy, I know you're gonna like your present."
1105,"All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad."
1106,"All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football."
1107,"But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
1108,"Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together."
1109,"Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted."
1110,"Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
1111,"Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney."
1112,"Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
1113,"Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat."
1114,Huh?
1115,"Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me."
1116,"Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?"
1117,It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?
1118,Okay.
1119,Dallas! Whoo-hoo!
1120,"However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?"
1121,"Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on..."""
1122,"Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here."
1123,"Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'."
1124,"I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it."
1125,Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!
1126,My daughter.
1127,Not Duff Dry... Dallas.
1128,Huh?
1129,"All right, we're back in business."
1130,"Please, please, please..."
1131,Yes! She loves me! She loves me!
1132,"Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"
1133,It's beautiful.
1134,After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?
1135,"Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese..."
1136,"Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole."
1137,Alley balls?
1138,Alley balls...
1139,"Hey sweetheart, what's the matter?! Not gettin' enough of the good stuff at home?"
1140,Let me through! Let me through! I'm her husband!
1141,Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello?
1142,What should I say?
1143,Yes it's me!
1144,I love you very much.
1145,"And uh... later tonight I think you and I should uh, snuggle."
1146,"Look Marge, I can tell something's bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey?"
1147,"Well, all's well that ends well. Goodnight, Marge."
1148,Whaa...
1149,"What? But Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns?"
1150,"I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach either. ""Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?"""
1151,"What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!"
1152,"Well, okay. But you have to swear you're comin' back."
1153,All right then.
1154,She's startin' to give.
1155,"For your information, I can take care of my --"
1156,See? Got her on the first bounce.
1157,Good bye? Where's my clean underwear?
1158,How often should I change Maggie?
1159,"Marge, Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker?"
1160,Hello Maggie.
1161,"Sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...And went far, far away..."
1162,"So, it's going to be just you and me for awhile. Just you and me."
1163,"C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num."
1164,Mmm. Strained peas.
1165,Let go!
1166,Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company.
1167,"All right, but just be careful."
1168,"GO TO SLEEP AND GOODNIGHT/ DA DA DA / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ DEE DEE DEE / DEE DEE / May your Christmas day be nice. Goodnight, my little pork chop."
1169,"Oh Maggie, time for your nine a.m. feeding."
1170,"Heh, heh, heh."
1171,Maggie?
1172,Maggie?
1173,Maggie?
1174,Maggie?
1175,Maggieeee!!!!
1176,"Barney, I've lost the baby. It's the worst thing I've ever done."
1177,Just help me look!
1178,C'mon!
1179,Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off.
1180,Hello... I'd like the department of missing babies.
1181,I came to see the kids.
1182,Hmmm.
1183,Hey kids... uh... you haven't seen Maggie around anyplace have you?
1184,"Well, I gotta go."
1185,Y'ello.
1186,"Listen, Marge, uh, how would you feel if I told you the dog ran away?"
1187,"Oh. Well, I've got good news for you. The dog didn't run away."
1188,"Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It's not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn't life funny? One day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. Oh."
1189,Yes.
1190,Uh... she's small... she's a girl...
1191,Oh Maggie!
1192,"You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
1193,You're not going anywhere.
1194,Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
1195,"You got it, sweetheart. You have enough blanket there?"
1196,Marge. Come here.
1197,Can you believe it? Pretty soon I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.
1198,"Marge, dogs love the outdoors."
1199,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
1200,"Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
1201,"Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house."
1202,Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.
1203,"This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see."
1204,Stupid lumber...
1205,Dammit! Son of a --
1206,The hell with this!
1207,"""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."""
1208,"Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt!"
1209,"What is it, Flanders?"
1210,"Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?"
1211,What the hell are you talking about?
1212,"Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache."
1213,Makes you look like you've got something to hide.
1214,People are talking... lots of people.
1215,Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.
1216,"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing."
1217,"Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?"
1218,"Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now."
1219,"Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar."
1220,Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?
1221,What if I catch on fire?
1222,What if I see something really weird in the sky?
1223,What about when we snuggle?
1224,God --
1225,"Ohh, you son-of-a."
1226,You dirty bas...
1227,"What do ya think, Lisa?"
1228,"Well, he just goes... Ohhh"
1229,"Oh fudge, that's broken."
1230,"Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down."
1231,Where'd you get the money?
1232,Maggie. Oh. Cute.
1233,Beer! How did you know?
1234,"Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night."
1235,"Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth."
1236,"Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear."
1237,Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
1238,"""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."""
1239,"I may hold you to that, Marge."
1240,Three simple words. I am gay.
1241,P.S. -- I am gay.
1242,"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"""
1243,Why you little...
1244,"Mmm, do - nuts."
1245,Don't tell me how to eat donuts --
1246,Softball?
1247,Who's next?
1248,What's the matter with you guys?
1249,"Look, I know it wasn't our best season."
1250,"Well, this year's gonna be different."
1251,I have a secret weapon.
1252,"Come here boy, I want to show you something."
1253,"It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house..."
1254,"Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find."
1255,"Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of."
1256,I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
1257,And here it is.
1258,Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
1259,"Check it out, boys. My magic bat."
1260,"Yeah, just watch."
1261,Woo hoooooo!
1262,Ha ha. Cops can't win!
1263,"Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion."
1264,"I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!"
1265,You're Darryl Strawberry.
1266,You play right field.
1267,I play right field too.
1268,"Well, are you better than me?"
1269,It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench.
1270,"Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do."
1271,"Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
1272,I got it! I got it!
1273,"Hey, I called for that!"
1274,No.
1275,"These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat."""
1276,"Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?"
1277,One thing I'm good at and I can't do it anymore.
1278,Like what?
1279,"Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me."
1280,Where do you think you're going?
1281,"No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
1282,"They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
1283,I am? Whoo-hoo!
1284,Yes.
1285,Uh uh.
1286,Got it.
1287,"Yes, sir!"
1288,Huh?
1289,Lurleen.
1290,"Good one, Lenny."
1291,"So what're you gonna be, boy?"
1292,"No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb."
1293,Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?
1294,Stupid fingers.
1295,"Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it."
1296,Good for you. Maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
1297,We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?
1298,Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid.
1299,Oh yeah.
1300,Yeah!
1301,One hundred and thirty million dollars!
1302,"Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?"
1303,You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!
1304,"I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money..."
1305,"You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you."
1306,"Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!"
1307,"Hey, down in front."
1308,Whoo-hoo!
1309,I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery.
1310,"Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
1311,What do kids know about spending money?
1312,Hmm...
1313,"Look closer, Lenny!"
1314,Fourteen carat gold!
1315,"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now."
1316,I've got so many tickets I can't lose!
1317,"Receipts, ugh."
1318,"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."""
1319,"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
1320,"Hey, you did the best you could."
1321,Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
1322,"Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven."
1323,"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and..."
1324,Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
1325,Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
1326,Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
1327,But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
1328,"Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop."
1329,All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.
1330,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
1331,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
1332,I thought maybe you...
1333,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
1334,What?
1335,But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
1336,"Maybe you're right, Marge."
1337,"Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?"
1338,Chub? I don't even know what that is!
1339,"Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
1340,"Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?"
1341,Mmm... snouts.
1342,"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
1343,A dinosaur.
1344,BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...
1345,AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!
1346,My quarter!!!
1347,"I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you."
1348,Yes.
1349,"Oh, you mean tonight."
1350,Bart! Close the gate.
1351,Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.
1352,Uh...the last one.
1353,"That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug."
1354,"Oh, Marge! There is no such place!"
1355,Or... to put it another way... there is.
1356,And I'll be right here watching TV.
1357,Two tickets for...
1358,Let me pet him again!
1359,I know. I want to pet him again!
1360,The cat? What's the point?
1361,"Oooh, there's a good one."
1362,"Marge, that's just a suggested car size."
1363,Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?
1364,"Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window."
1365,"Ooh, they all look great."
1366,"Look Who's Oinking! ""Look Who's Oinking""!"
1367,That's right.
1368,"Why Marge, you frisky little devil."
1369,"We'll take two tickets to ""The Stockholm Affair."""
1370,Political!
1371,"Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky..."
1372,"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""
1373,"Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!"
1374,What?
1375,I think that guy's a spy.
1376,"Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter."
1377,"Hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it."
1378,"Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again."
1379,Mmm...
1380,"Ew, a skunk!"
1381,Oh no.
1382,"Ooh, a redneck bar."
1383,Duff please.
1384,"Okay, Fudd me."
1385,Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
1386,Yeah...
1387,... that's true.
1388,Uh-huh.
1389,"That's right, except for the pick-up truck."
1390,"Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they..."
1391,"Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya."
1392,Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?
1393,Homer J. Simpson.
1394,That's a pretty name.
1395,Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
1396,Bye Lurleen.
1397,Y'ello.
1398,I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.
1399,"Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'."
1400,I WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ I SWEAT AND BREAK MY BACK/
1401,YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO...
1402,"Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?"
1403,"Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town."
1404,"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town."""
1405,Do you think I could get a copy of it?
1406,"Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!"
1407,Come with me!
1408,I guess so.
1409,"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
1410,"Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
1411,"Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
1412,"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife."
1413,It's a date!
1414,"Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain."
1415,"Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it."
1416,"Thanks. You did say sugar, right?"
1417,"Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures..."
1418,I make a lot of stupid decisions...
1419,I did bad in school.
1420,My personal hygiene has been described as...
1421,"Marge, look at me."
1422,"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
1423,A friend bought it for me.
1424,No... I think it was Lenny.
1425,No!
1426,No!
1427,A coupla times.
1428,I can't. I'm her manager.
1429,"Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."
1430,"Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there."
1431,I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
1432,"Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this."
1433,"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen."
1434,"I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!"
1435,Stop it.
1436,"You, off the bench."
1437,"Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV."
1438,"Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new."
1439,Let's hear it.
1440,"Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye."
1441,Uh-huh...
1442,Right...
1443,Uh... I gotta think about this.
1444,"Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready."
1445,"That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?"
1446,Sure they will.
1447,Uh... I gotta go.
1448,Yes I am.
1449,"Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy."
1450,"Lurleen, they loved you."
1451,Is there anything you need?
1452,My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
1453,At least could I have my dollar ba...
1454,I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
1455,"Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
1456,Okay.
1457,"Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer."
1458,You son of a... Sold!
1459,Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
1460,"Look Maggie, they have a baby, too."
1461,Pfft.
1462,Ooooh.
1463,"Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
1464,Lousy snitch.
1465,I am not.
1466,Hear hear!.
1467,"Oooh, appetizers."
1468,"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!"
1469,"Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?"
1470,"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love."
1471,"Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going?"
1472,"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
1473,"Hey, down in front."
1474,Come again?
1475,To the Simpson mobile!
1476,"Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer."
1477,Billy Beer!
1478,"Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me."
1479,I hear ya. Come on boy.
1480,"Now, just meet me back here after the show."
1481,"Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
1482,"Oh, Baby!"
1483,THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...
1484,I'll be right back.
1485,"Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar."
1486,This is real.
1487,"Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!"
1488,"Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him."
1489,"Marge, what were you thinking?"
1490,"Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape."
1491,Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
1492,"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
1493,All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.
1494,Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
1495,"That's better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?"
1496,"Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV."
1497,It doesn't matter.
1498,Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.
1499,That guy has gotta go.
1500,That's it. He's outta here.
1501,"I don't care. This is not ""Happy Days"" and he is not the Fonz."
1502,"Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!"
1503,Why you little...
1504,What the...
1505,So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.
1506,This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
1507,"Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance."
1508,Chocolate...
1509,"Ooh, sweet."
1510,"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?"
1511,"Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
1512,"Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?"
1513,"Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?"
1514,"Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
1515,Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
1516,"Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
1517,Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.
1518,Ooh...a sextet of ale.
1519,Nah.
1520,The vernal equinox?
1521,Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!
1522,"Marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
1523,Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.
1524,Yeah that's good.
1525,"Forgot there was a physical today, huh?"
1526,Go to hell.
1527,"Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
1528,Herb?
1529,What the hell are you two...
1530,"Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?"
1531,"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
1532,"Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories."
1533,Boring.
1534,"Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house."
1535,"Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse."
1536,That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse.
1537,Would I!
1538,"Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
1539,Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?
1540,Herb!
1541,Please please please please please...
1542,Don't jinx it!
1543,"Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!"
1544,I miss my couch.
1545,Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
1546,I think I'm gonna take a walk.
1547,"I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless."
1548,Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.
1549,Give me full power.
1550,"Dammit, I said full power!"
1551,I'll take it.
1552,"Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer."
1553,"All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky."
1554,They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf.
1555,You weren't so glad to see me.
1556,"Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
1557,"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode."
1558,On... off... on... off.
1559,"Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does."
1560,They do good work.
1561,"Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman."
1562,"Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
1563,Nah.
1564,Twenty minutes?!
1565,It's drinking the water!
1566,This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
1567,It's going back for more!
1568,"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
1569,"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird."
1570,"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
1571,"I try, but I can't."
1572,Never mind.
1573,"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
1574,I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
1575,"Well, when is he gonna act like it?"
1576,"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
1577,"What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it."
1578,That's it?
1579,"I see your point, brother."
1580,All right... but I never really hugged a man before.
1581,"Wake up, boy."
1582,Well it is.
1583,"Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door."
1584,"Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty."
1585,"Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers."
1586,Woo-hoo!
1587,Stupid roller-skate.
1588,"A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?"
1589,You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.
1590,"Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?"
1591,Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
1592,"Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
1593,"Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?"
1594,"I don't see your name on it, boy."
1595,Oh yeah?
1596,Check... mate.
1597,"""Leaves of 4, eat some more."""
1598,Oh no you're not.
1599,He-he-he.
1600,"Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds!"
1601,And look. New hair!
1602,I'm this close to having a comb-over!
1603,Size... right... agility!
1604,"Ah, kids' letters from camp."
1605,"Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here."
1606,Don't be the boy. Don't be the boy.
1607,Sounds interesting.
1608,Sounds interesting.
1609,A beaut from Butte.
1610,Nothin' could be finah.
1611,"She, uh... Good for her."
1612,Marge keep it down in there.
1613,Maggie! Cut that racket!
1614,And where exactly are you going?
1615,"Well, this is the first I've heard about it."
1616,"Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I'm not an idiot!"
1617,"Kids, back me up."
1618,"Match point, Homer."
1619,That's okay. We're none of us perfect.
1620,"Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity?"
1621,Make Bart do it.
1622,"You see, Marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too."
1623,"Marge, your ride's here."
1624,"Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?"
1625,"Hey, there's quarters in here!"
1626,"Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I'll be out in the car."
1627,"Marge, move it or lose it!"
1628,Salt me.
1629,Wha th... Why are you talking like that?
1630,I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock.
1631,"But Marge, what about dessert?"
1632,Fine. I will!
1633,"Oh no! My pudding is trapped forever. So I can open my own can of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge!"
1634,"Maaaarge! Hey, Maaaaaarrrrge!"
1635,So what time does this play start?
1636,"Well I gotta, don't I?"
1637,Probably not much of it.
1638,"Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
1639,"You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing."
1640,You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night.
1641,"Maggie, time to go to the..."
1642,Babies.
1643,Huh?
1644,"Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing."
1645,Shut up boy.
1646,"Marge, you were terrific."
1647,I wasn't bored. I was sad. It really got to me how that lady -- Uh... uh... you know which one I mean. You played her.
1648,Yeah. How Blanche was sad and how that guy Stanley -- should have been nice to her.
1649,I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
1650,"Hey, you know. I'm a lot like that guy."
1651,"Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff..."
1652,"Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la..."
1653,Leggo! Leggo!
1654,I'm all naked and wet!
1655,Don' wanna go.
1656,Too cold out!
1657,"Oh, stupid itchy church pants..."
1658,"One size fits all, my butt!"
1659,Forget it. I'm not going.
1660,"Ahhh. I'm just a big toasty cinnamon bun. I never want to leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man, think... think, think, think. I better get up."
1661,I'm whizzing with the door open -- and I love it!
1662,"Whyyy, oh whyyy... Delilahhh?"
1663,You bet your sweet... ass!
1664,I wear short shorts!
1665,"The perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world Moon Waffles."
1666,"Let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke..."
1667,"Oooh, waffle run off."
1668,"Mmm, fattening."
1669,"Uh-oh. Here, boy."
1670,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
1671,I know that!
1672,"Hello, this is Homer Simpson."
1673,This Things I Believe.
1674,Woo-hoo!
1675,Heh-heh-heh... Moe is their leader.
1676,"Come on TV... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!"
1677,"Oh, well... can't win 'em all."
1678,Yesss!
1679,Woo-hoo!
1680,Is that what I think it is?
1681,I... found... a penny!
1682,Could this be the best day of my life?
1683,Looks like we have a new champion.
1684,"Ah, my beloved family. How was church?"
1685,"I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church!"
1686,"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again."
1687,"No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes."
1688,"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?"
1689,And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
1690,And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
1691,"Marge, come to bed."
1692,Maarge... come to bed Marge...
1693,It's good for what ails ya...
1694,I can wait all --
1695,God?
1696,Well... kind of... but...
1697,And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.
1698,I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?
1699,No. They moved to Phoenix.
1700,You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
1701,Give him one for me.
1702,"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
1703,"Sure, honey."
1704,"Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed."
1705,"Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you."
1706,"Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?"
1707,"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path."
1708,"Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge."
1709,Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
1710,Yeah... think about it.
1711,"Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy."
1712,"Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No Hell... no kneeling...."
1713,No sale.
1714,Leave me alone!
1715,Where are we going?
1716,"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"
1717,There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...
1718,Very sure.
1719,"Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait, that's no good. Hey, now we're talkin'. ""Our Unabashed Dictionary defines IUD as 'Love Springs Internal'."" I don't get it."
1720,"Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?"
1721,Sorry.
1722,"Apu, I see you're not in church."
1723,"Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?"
1724,"No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
1725,"Boy, everyone is stupid except me."
1726,"Marge, turn down the heat. That's better."
1727,"Fire! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, the song! The song! WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN / THERE'S A LESSON YOU MUST LEARN / SOMETHING... SOMETHING, THEN YOU'LL SEE/YOU'LL AVOID CATASTROPHE!"
1728,"Flanders, you saved me. Why?"
1729,"That's right, old friend."
1730,"My Magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone."
1731,"Hey, wait a minute... Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house!"
1732,"Well, the Picasso... my collection of classic cars..."
1733,"Well, that's just great."
1734,"You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here."
1735,"No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!"
1736,"I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am."
1737,"I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!"
1738,"God, I gotta ask you somethin'. What's the meaning of life?"
1739,C'mon.
1740,I can't wait that long.
1741,"No, tell me now!"
1742,"Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!"
1743,A ride on the Duff Blimp...
1744,Wow.
1745,"Ho-mer, Ho-mer, Ho-mer.."
1746,"Oh, it's no fair. We'll never have a buffer."
1747,"Well, I want that one."
1748,Oh my God!
1749,HEY THERE BLIMPY BOY /FLYING THROUGH THE SKY SO FANCY FREE.
1750,"Honey, what's wrong?"
1751,What are you talking about?
1752,"Heh heh heh... Oh, Lisa, this isn't real. It's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character."
1753,Now that's not true! You're cute as a bug's ear.
1754,"Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?"
1755,"There, see?"
1756,"Moe, have you ever felt unattractive?"
1757,"How about you, Barney?"
1758,I need help.
1759,Lisa's age seven to nine!
1760,That could be Lisa!
1761,"Hey, Barney, will you give me 250 bucks for this blimp ticket?"
1762,Where'd you get all the money?
1763,"Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?"
1764,"Uh, was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant?"
1765,"I sent in an application for you. I couldn't find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates."
1766,But I think she'll win.
1767,"Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl."
1768,"Well, if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would. But to me, she's beautiful."
1769,Hey there blimpy boy Flying through the sky so fancy free --
1770,"Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks."
1771,"No, she won't. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return."
1772,I'll tell you when you're older.
1773,"Is that Lisa? Ooh, I gotta call heaven -- there's an angel missing!"
1774,Hey... hey!
1775,"Nope, that's it."
1776,Yeah! Clean up this stink hole!
1777,They'll love you just as much as I do.
1778,Hmmm.
1779,Bless you boys.
1780,I know.
1781,If it wasn't for me you'd still be queen. You must hate me.
1782,I don't know. Was I drunk?
1783,Really?
1784,Will you remember this the next
1785,time I wreck your life?
1786,Oh yeah? With what?
1787,"I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave..."
1788,I will get you one now!
1789,Do you sell toys?
1790,"Well, I need something for my son's birthday."
1791,"Ooh, that's bad."
1792,That's good.
1793,That's bad.
1794,That's good.
1795,Can I go now?
1796,"Happy birthday, son!"
1797,Woo hoo!
1798,Didn't even pull the string that time.
1799,That doll tried to kill me!
1800,Don't leave me alone with him.
1801,MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT'S H-O-M-E-R.
1802,"Goodbye, Dolly."
1803,And that is that.
1804,"Marge, Marge, look!"
1805,The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!
1806,Ew. Dog water.
1807,Come here you.
1808,Did you walk the dog?
1809,"Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk."
1810,"... So then, his wife comes through the door!!!"
1811,Did I mention she was dead?
1812,"Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club!"
1813,Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
1814,Ooo.
1815,Did you wreck the car?
1816,Did you raise the dead?
1817,But the car is okay?
1818,All right then.
1819,"Why? Oh, the zombies. No."
1820,Spare my family. Take me. Take me!
1821,To the book depository!
1822,He was a zombie?
1823,I'm a-comin' boy!
1824,"Barney! Not you, too!"
1825,Take that Washington!
1826,"Eat lead, Einstein!"
1827,"Show's over, Shakespeare!"
1828,Man... fall down. Funny.
1829,Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.
1830,Oh no. I'm not making two stops.
1831,"All right, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year. You can have Bart's."
1832,All right. Tell you what. I'm thinking of a number between one and 50.
1833,"I mean, no."
1834,"Please Marge... please, please, please, please, please?"
1835,Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!
1836,Hee hee!
1837,I did. I did read to her!
1838,"Eight o'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he's losing his cool."
1839,"Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three ""R's"": ""reading TV Guide""... ummmm, writing to TV Guide... and renewing TV Guide."
1840,"""My child is on the Honor Roll at Springfield Elementary."" You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my ""Where's the Beef"" bumper sticker. Heh, heh, heh... ""Where's the Beef""."
1841,Huh? Oh.
1842,Bus-ted!
1843,Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!
1844,Oh. That guy.
1845,He's the boy you love to hate.
1846,Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger.
1847,If you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.
1848,"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""
1849,"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
1850,"But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present."
1851,"All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
1852,"Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza."
1853,Just promise me you'll try to be good.
1854,Thataboy.
1855,"Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?"
1856,"Hey you goats, get outta here!"
1857,"Boy, you're going to have to be punished for this."
1858,"Run along, ya little scamp."
1859,Bart! Why are you doing that?
1860,"Well, this time you must be punished."
1861,"No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute..."
1862,Ice cream truck!
1863,"Me, me. I was here first!"
1864,"Now, what were we talking about, boy?"
1865,Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
1866,I'unno.
1867,"All right. All right. Bart, go to your room."
1868,How could you let this happen?
1869,Oh. How convenient.
1870,Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?
1871,Now who's being naive.
1872,"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick."
1873,"Sorry, but the punishment stands."
1874,"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?"
1875,"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!"
1876,"Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!"
1877,Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
1878,Hmm...
1879,"YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU..."
1880,"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING..."
1881,"Someday you'll thank me for this, son."
1882,"No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage."
1883,I like stories.
1884,"I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV."
1885,"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that."
1886,But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.
1887,Don't you think I know that?
1888,"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen."
1889,"No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special."
1890,All right. I think you've learned your lesson.
1891,I'll get it son.
1892,Mmm... Soylent Green.
1893,Which one's the mouse?
1894,Itchy's a jerk.
1895,"Oooh, give it here."
1896,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
1897,I wish I could retire.
1898,"Boy, that'd be sweet."
1899,Can't talk -- busy.
1900,All part of God's great plan.
1901,The half-assed approach to foundation repair.
1902,Ready!
1903,"Hand me my patching trowel, boy."
1904,Hmm.
1905,No.
1906,Wha-do I do...
1907,Wait a minute...
1908,Wait a minute...
1909,Uh huh?
1910,Did you see the bubble?
1911,Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!
1912,"Let's see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are..."
1913,Huh?
1914,"Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
1915,Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
1916,"March 15... I wish I'd brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV."
1917,Bo-ring!
1918,Bo-ring.
1919,"Forget it Marge. We already live together; we shouldn't work together. As the Bible says ""Thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's... racket."""
1920,"It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad."
1921,Marge have you seen my lunch box?
1922,"Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home..."
1923,"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now."
1924,"Yeah, lemonade is good."
1925,Wha dey do?
1926,"Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt ."
1927,Marge what're you doing? It's lunch time.
1928,"Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under ""R"" for arrivederci."
1929,"Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do."
1930,"Marge, get my gun."
1931,You can't take our donuts!
1932,"Oh, man, I really gotta..."
1933,I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.
1934,Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.
1935,"Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight."
1936,I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
1937,The senile old fool.
1938,He left his briefcase. Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers.
1939,"No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
1940,Damn right!
1941,"Gotcha. Marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice."
1942,"Ooh, me too."
1943,"Ahhh, bacon."
1944,"Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?"
1945,Mmm... no.
1946,Mmm... no.
1947,"Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin' to you! Get off my lawn! Now!"
1948,"Hello, what's this? Wire hangers! Expired medicine! Old newspapers! Okay Homer, stay calm. Just quietly get this stuff inside your house."
1949,"Homer, you're not listening!"
1950,"Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
1951,"Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant."
1952,"Mmmm, shrimp."
1953,"There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?"
1954,My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.
1955,"...All you can eat, ha!"
1956,"Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels."
1957,"No ""All You Can Eat Seafood."" I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing!"
1958,"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around..."
1959,"That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing."
1960,"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
1961,"Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?"
1962,I hear you loud and clear.
1963,All you can eat. All you can eat.
1964,Can't talk... eating.
1965,"Hey, hey, hey!"
1966,"But the sign said ""All you can eat."""
1967,I'm gonna fight this thing.
1968,"Sorry Marge, this is my quest. I'm like that guy -- that Spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills..."
1969,"No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha."
1970,No!
1971,Fine. I'll look it up.
1972,Never mind.
1973,All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now!
1974,So you think I have a case?
1975,Woo hoo!
1976,Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
1977,"..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town."
1978,"But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did."
1979,"Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father."
1980,"Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!"
1981,"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch..."
1982,I married her!
1983,"Thanks, that means a lot to me."
1984,Hey!
1985,Right here.
1986,"Come on, Marge, let the people see your pretty face."
1987,How someone someone abuse their body that way?
1988,Moe! Don't throw out that brine!
1989,"But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban."
1990,Ohh.
1991,"Well, I got him as good as he got me."
1992,It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography.
1993,What country is this car from?
1994,"Kids! If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free."
1995,Do you come with the car?
1996,Bart! That car belonged to Bonnie and Clyde! Show a little respect.
1997,The Batmobile!
1998,"Adam West! Hey kids, Batman!"
1999,Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact.
2000,Wow! Just think what I could do with that plow.
2001,"Mr. President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality."
2002,"Eh, I can't afford it."
2003,Well... I really should discuss this with my wife.
2004,What? You think I'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise?
2005,I'll take it!
2006,"If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things."
2007,Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night!
2008,No.
2009,Marge didn't reckon with these fliers and this flashy jacket.
2010,"Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226."
2011,"Not as low as my low, low prices."
2012,"Uh, huh, that's Mr. Plow."
2013,I'm gonna lose my plow.
2014,Hmmm.
2015,Almost time for our commercial.
2016,"Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners..."
2017,It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV!
2018,Stop!
2019,"Get out of here, you lousy... season!"
2020,"Hello, I'm Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?"
2021,Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt.
2022,He could still surprise ya!
2023,"Absolutely! My prices are so low, you'll think I've suffered brain damage."
2024,"Shut up, boy."
2025,So remember...
2026,"CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW!"
2027,"Well, John Q Driveway has our number. Now we play the waiting game."
2028,"The waiting game sucks. Let's play ""Hungry, Hungry Hippos."""
2029,"Well wishing won't make it so. You've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be."
2030,"How do you think he'll do, Moe?"
2031,Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth?
2032,Oooh. Heh heh heh.
2033,CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW.
2034,"Ah, white gold."
2035,What the... What happ... uh... oh no...
2036,"Barney, you stole my idea!"
2037,"How could you, Barney? After all I've done for you."
2038,"Flanders, I thought I was your plow man."
2039,Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
2040,Mr. West! You said there was a job for me!
2041,"Ring, damn you. Ring!"
2042,Mister Plow... that name again is Mr. Plow.
2043,"Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from ""Leave It To Beaver""? Yeah, they were gay."
2044,"Oh, what am I gonna do?"
2045,I know! I'll do a rap. I'M MR. PLOW AND I'M HERE TO SAY: I'M THE PLOWINGEST GUY IN THE USA / I GOT A BIG PLOW AND I MOVE A LOT OF THINGS / LIKE YOUR COW IT YOU HAVE ONE.
2046,All right.
2047,I don't know.
2048,I thought there was chocolate inside.
2049,"Well, why was it wrapped in foil?"
2050,Hmm...
2051,Hello... Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow's Peak.
2052,"There's a $10,000 bill in it for you."
2053,Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.
2054,"Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers."
2055,Kiss my asphalt.
2056,"So I says, ""Kiss my asphalt."" Hmm? Hmm?"
2057,This is all my fault. I've gotta save him.
2058,"Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat."
2059,Easy... easy...
2060,Barney!
2061,"Barney, that's great. When two best friends work together, not even God, Himself, can stop them."
2062,Y'ello.
2063,Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I --
2064,You mean...
2065,"MR. PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME. THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on."
2066,"Maggie, can you say ""daddy""? Dad-dy?"
2067,"Did you hear that? She said ""burlap."""
2068,Takes one to know one!
2069,"Yeah, tell it, Mom."
2070,WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THAT'S ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT...
2071,Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy.
2072,Daddy.
2073,Daddy.
2074,Ye-esss...
2075,Why you little...
2076,He'll tire himself out soon.
2077,"Heh, heh. Got your nose."
2078,"Nooo! Bart, don't you ever do that again. Understand?"
2079,We're gonna start doin' it in the morning?
2080,Oh.
2081,Marge that's...
2082,"No, we won't. I've got it all figured out. The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21!"
2083,My cousin Frank did it.
2084,"He became Francine back in '76. Then he joined that cult. I think his name is Mother Shabubu, now."
2085,Mmmm. Hog fat.
2086,Once we get these cats out of the way it won't be too bad.
2087,Wow. How much? How much?
2088,I can't afford that!
2089,"Dad, I have a problem."
2090,Are you done?
2091,"Dad, I don't need advice, I need $15,000 to buy a home."
2092,You didn't build this house. You won
2093,it on a crooked '50's game show!
2094,"Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. I'd be honored if you came to live with us."
2095,About three weeks.
2096,Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk.
2097,What? What?
2098,"All right, you win round seven."
2099,Your what-what?
2100,"Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes."
2101,"Wait a minute. That was a ""Lucy"" show... Okay, where were we?"
2102,Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in...
2103,"Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me ""Daddy."""
2104,"Hi, Flanders."
2105,I could use a TV tray.
2106,Whaat?
2107,"You said, anything."
2108,"And that ""little while"" is now eight years and counting. Heh heh heh."
2109,"Not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day."
2110,Duh.
2111,"All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let's go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib."
2112,"Ah, Homer J. Simpson, you're a genius."
2113,"I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed. Now you can laugh yourself to sleep."
2114,"Patience, my pet."
2115,Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life?
2116,Yes!
2117,"Shut up, Flanders."
2118,Little Lisa. I've already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan.
2119,"Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt."
2120,"Bart, there's someone in here who wants to meet you."
2121,Where's the beef? No wonder he won Minnesota.
2122,I like those odds.
2123,"Please, please, please, please, please..."
2124,"Can you say ""Daddy""?"
2125,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!...
2126,"Here, Bart, you can hold my beer."
2127,What?
2128,"Goodnight, honey."
2129,"Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah."
2130,"No, sweetie. ""Daddy."""
2131,"Y'know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back."
2132,I hope you never say a word.
2133,I can't wait till they throw his hatless butt in jail.
2134,My heart is just fine...
2135,Just workin' the turkey through. There it goes!
2136,You know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? I've got that right now. Ooh... bacon!
2137,It could only be one thing.
2138,What the hell is this?
2139,"Ooh, oatmeal. What a delightful treat. Ugh, there's a bug in it."
2140,Trust me.
2141,Eh.
2142,"Come on, come on!"
2143,I keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.
2144,Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission.
2145,Huh?
2146,Mmm... ham.
2147,More.
2148,Thank you.
2149,"Marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes."
2150,FALL ON YOUR KNEES / OH HEAR THE ANGELS' VOICES /
2151,"OH NI-IGHT, DI- Vine. Hey, my voice just changed."
2152,"OH NIGHT, WHEN CHRIST WAS BORN..."
2153,"But I'm out of the woods now, right? I mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger."
2154,"Hey, c'mon, quit it."
2155,Stop. Please stop.
2156,"Please, have mercy."
2157,Not funny.
2158,No! Remember your hippopotamus oath.
2159,What an age we live in!
2160,Hi.
2161,"Woo hoo, look at that blubber fly."
2162,"Say it in English, doc."
2163,Spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
2164,Could you dumb it down a shade?
2165,"Okay, okay. We need forty-thousand dollars. Now, how much do we have in the checkbook?"
2166,"Hmm, have we deposited any forty-thousand dollar checks that haven't cleared yet?"
2167,"Well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge."
2168,"Don't worry, Marge. America's healthcare system is second only to Japan... Canada, Sweden, Great Britain. Well, all of Europe. But you can thank your lucky stars we don't live in Paraguay."
2169,"Questions? Questions? Oh gee, my whole scheme down the... I mean, ask away."
2170,"Oh, I thought that said, ""Brain Hemorrhages."""
2171,I do enjoy a snifter of port at Christmas.
2172,"Now let me tell you something, Mr. Sucker... I just..."
2173,Oh. I...
2174,Must... sign... policy...
2175,"I made an ""H""."
2176,"Looks like an ""X."""
2177,Can I have a free calendar?
2178,"Oh doctor, I was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone. And there were all these guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks in my butt."
2179,I can't afford it. Maybe I should buy one of those machines.
2180,"Oh yeah, that's the stuff."
2181,"Now, I know I haven't been the best Christian. In fact, when you're up there ""Blah, blah, blah-ing"" I'm usually doodling or mentally undressing the female parishioners... well, anyhoo... can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
2182,"Now, I know I haven't been the best Jew... but I rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and I will watch it. Anyway, can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
2183,"Now, I know I haven't been the best... aw, forget it."
2184,"No, but the rabbi gave me this."
2185,"Son, they call it a ""droodle"". Whoo hoo! Look at him go!"
2186,Bo-ring.
2187,"Well, Marge, we could do worse."
2188,Uh... some dog could do the operation.
2189,"Kids, I have something to tell you."
2190,Really? What's it like?
2191,"Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it."
2192,So the tiny Aorta Fairies will take Mr. Leg Vein on a long trip to get married to Princess Left Ventricle.
2193,"Uh, yeah."
2194,Kids. Kids... I'm not gonna die. That only happens to bad people.
2195,Uh... he sold poison milk to school children.
2196,"Hey, I'm just trying to make it easier on 'em."
2197,Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down. Bed goes up. Bed goes down.
2198,Flanders? What are you doin' here?
2199,Who are you donating them to?
2200,I got a bad heart.
2201,"Shut up, Flanders."
2202,"Dear Lord, I'm really scared about this operation tomorrow. If something happens, please look after Marge, and make sure my kids grow up right."
2203,Sorry.
2204,Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down...
2205,Bed goes up. Bed goes down...
2206,"Krusty, why are you here?"
2207,"Oh well, I could use a good laugh."
2208,You seem okay.
2209,"Gee, thanks, guys."
2210,"Barney, I'm not getting a sex change!"
2211,"Thanks, Moe."
2212,"Oh, my little Maggie, I may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants."
2213,"Now, Marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're gonna be lonely..."
2214,"Darn right. And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows."
2215,"Bed goes up... Kids, I want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. Let's see... uh... Oh, I'm no good at this."
2216,"Bart, the saddest thing about this is I won't get to see you grow up, because..."
2217,"I know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man."
2218,And Lisa...
2219,I guess this is the time to tell you...
2220,You're adopted and I don't like you.
2221,Bart!
2222,"But don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you."
2223,Yabba dabba doo!

2233,Maybe.
2234,What's it to ya?
2235,Does whiskey count as beer?
2236,"Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor."
2237,It's my life-long dream.
2238,"Oh, yeah."
2239,"Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true."
2240,"That's right, boy."
2241,Heh-heh. Kids.

2243,"""What if?"" What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed!"

2245,What if I undo this button?
2246,What if I talk like this?
2247,What if I SING TO YOU? I GAVE MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE/ Mmmm chicken.
2248,"Who, me?"
2249,Woo-hoo!
2250,"And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake."

2255,I locked my keys in there. Get a rock.
2256,All aboard!

2258,I'm trying my best.
2259,I did it!
2260,"Are we gonna die, son?"
2261,Y'ello.
2262,Batman?
2263,Batman's a scientist.
2264,I'll take that.
2265,Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?
2266,"Yes, son. I'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was."
2267,Wowww.
2268,"Bart, warm up the car. We're going to Duff Gardens."
2269,"Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?"
2270,"And I'm a college student! Heh, heh."
2271,But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now!

2278,What?
2279,"All right, I'm almost there."
2280,Please.
2281,"Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers."
2282,"It's just not fair, dammit!"
2283,All in favor of skipping the poem?
2284,Thank you.
2285,"Uh, oh."
2286,Sure... unless another aunt dies.
2287,"Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot."
2288,I knew that.
2289,Sand... wich...
2290,I'll give it a good home.
2291,Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge.
2292,Suggestion noted.
2293,"Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment."
2294,Yes.
2295,I don't care. I'm going to Duff Gardens.
2296,S-s-o cold.
2297,No! Duff... Gardens... hurrah!
2298,But I love solids.
2299,"This is all your fault! Oh, how can I stay mad at you?"
2300,No. What are the odds of getting sick on a Saturday? A thousand to one.
2301,Yentl? Whuzzat?
2302,Sounds great!
2303,"That Yentl puts the ""she"" in Yeshiva."
2304,That's what you think .
2305,The Erotic Adventures of Hercules.
2306,Woo hoo!
2307,Come to Homercles.
2308,Homercles cares not for beans.
2309,"Hi, kids. How was Duff Gardens?"
2310,"You take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around like this..."
2311,I'm on my way!
2312,"What'd ya say, Marge?"
2313,"Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something."
2314,I can't think with all this noise!
2315,What am I supposed to do?
2316,Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?
2317,Bart?... Bart!
2318,Whyyyyy?!... Howwwww?!... Whennnn?!... Whichhh?...
2319,Bart!
2320,"Shut up, Flanders."
2321,"Hey, boy. How was soccer practice?"
2322,"Hey, Bart, son. Here's my way of saying, ""I'm sorry."""
2323,"I know you're mad at me right now, and I'm kinda mad too... I mean, we could sit here and try to figure out ""who forgot to pick up who"" till the cows come home. But let's just say we're both wrong and that'll be that."
2324,Now how about a hug?
2325,Bart's not mad at me.
2326,"Marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. And to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. Permit me to demonstrate."
2327,"It's that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! It's not fair, it's not fair I tells ya."
2328,Wasn't me.
2329,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2330,Hit me.
2331,Hit me.
2332,Hit me.
2333,"Hey, boy! Where you going?"
2334,Have a good time! Wait a minute.
2335,So that's it!
2336,"Hello, son. Where have you been?"
2337,"No, you haven't! You've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! Haven't you, haven't you. Look at me."
2338,"How would you like me to take it? ""Go ahead, Bart, have your fun, I'll be waiting for you?"" I'm sorry, I can't do it."
2339,Uh... Revenge.
2340,What the?
2341,Ugly... wiener... crater face... Soo-ee! Soo-ee!...
2342,"Ehhh, maybe this was a mistake."
2343,I'll take him! Do you have him in blonde?
2344,Pepi!
2345,"Son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now."
2346,"Oh, he is."
2347,"Son, I just want you to know I love you very much."
2348,Mmm... grapefruit.
2349,I just press this button and the door opens like magic.
2350,Because it's a stupid piece of junk!
2351,"Well, I'd better get you home."
2352,What's the matter?
2353,"Well, there's... Jerry, the cowboy. And that big dipper-looking thing is Alan... the cowboy."
2354,"""Learned,"" son, it's pronounced ""learned."""
2355,"I love you too, Pepsi."
2356,Pepi.
2357,I gave it to Pepi.
2358,He's my little brother. That's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.
2359,"Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I used to push you on the swing?"
2360,Liar!
2361,Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
2362,No.
2363,"Come 'n' get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Come `n get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Stupid dolphin."
2364,Hey!
2365,He's got my hotdog!
2366,"Oh... it's you. So, you're looking well."
2367,"For your information, I'm his father!"
2368,That's right. And who might you be?
2369,Look! There's another disadvantaged boy.
2370,Oh. Right.
2371,This is even more painful than it looks.
2372,"Thanks, son."
2373,Yeah?
2374,"Sure, boy."
2375,"First, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. That's when it's time to kick some back."
2376,And then when he's lying on the ground...
2377,Kick him in the ribs...
2378,"Step on his neck, and run like hell."
2379,Happy... Valentine's Day!
2380,Woo hoo!
2381,"Uh, kind of. Nobody makes a big deal out of Valentine's Day."
2382,"What a nice idea, son. It's uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. I'll just go get it."
2383,"Apu, you gotta help me! I need a valentine's gift for my wife."
2384,Perhaps this might be appropriate.
2385,Yes! You saved my life. How much?
2386,What? That's highway robbery! I won't pay it!
2387,"Forget it, pal!"
2388,All right. But I'll never shop here again.
2389,Sold!
2390,I'd sell my first-born son.
2391,You'll do as your told.
2392,"Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love life have been without it?"
2393,"Let me handle this, Marge. I've heard 'em all. ""I like you as a friend,"" ""I think we should see other people,"" I no speak English""..."
2394,"""I'm married to the sea,"" ""I don't want to kill you, but I will--"
2395,"And if that doesn't work, six simple words: ""I'm not gay, but I'll learn."""
2396,Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?
2397,Eww.
2398,She's in the can. Go away.
2399,Really?
2400,"Yeah, they'll do that."
2401,"Sure it is, honey. You do mean stealing, don't you?"
2402,"Your conscience? Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do."
2403,"Homer, that's a terrible thing to say."
2404,"Oh, shaddup."
2405,"Yes, sir."
2406,"Something wrong, officer?"
2407,Where?
2408,"You know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops."
2409,"C'mon, boy! Finish him off!"
2410,Woo hoo!
2411,"Yeah, syrup is better than jelly."
2412,"Where's your Science Fair project, boy?"
2413,"Whelp, time to go to work."
2414,"Roll in at nine, punch out at five. That's the plan."
2415,Then to the Duff Brewery.
2416,"I gotta think of a lie, fast."
2417,"If the plant ye wish to flee, go to sector 7-B."
2418,"To overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a bible verse. Uh, thou shall not..."
2419,The man never drank a Duff in his life.
2420,Like what?
2421,Why not?
2422,No.
2423,Mmmm... Gummi Beer.
2424,"Hey, Barney. I think you've had enough."
2425,"Barney, give me your keys. You're too drunk to drive."
2426,"Okay, you leave me no option."
2427,I'm trying to knock you out.
2428,Gulp.
2429,"W,X,Y, AND Z / NOW I KNOW MY ABC'S / WON'T YOU COME AND PLAY WITH ME?"
2430,"Your Honor, I'd like that last remark stricken from the record."
2431,"Stupid bicycle. Can't believe this. No good, rotten..."
2432,I guess it's not all bad.
2433,"It's funny `cause I don't know him. Heh, heh, heh."
2434,I'm here for the Alch-anon meeting.
2435,My name is Homer and I'm just here because the court made me come.
2436,So they say I might have a problem.
2437,Does the Lord count as a person?
2438,"Then, yes."
2439,"Thank you, that'd be nice."
2440,Do I ever!
2441,Ah.
2442,You name it.
2443,You got it. No deer for a month.
2444,Deer.
2445,"All right. Starting tomorrow, no beer for a month."
2446,"I was saying ""Pssst. I love you."""
2447,"Well, beer... we've had some great times."
2448,WHEN I WAS 17 / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER / I DRANK SOME VERY GOOD BEER I PURCHASED WITH A FAKE I.D. / MY NAME WAS BRIAN MCGEE / I STAYED UP LISTENING TO QUEEN
2449,WHEN I WAS 17.
2450,Hm. Alcohol fueled car.
2451,One for you... one for me... One for you... one for me...
2452,One down. Twenty-nine to go.
2453,"T.V. have you turned on me, too?"
2454,I never realized how boring this game is.
2455,I think I've lost weight.
2456,I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
2457,The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
2458,Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer... Don't think about beer...
2459,Nooooo!
2460,Thirty days!
2461,"Marge, I'm going to Moe's. Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' back loaded."
2462,"But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill..."
2463,Yoink.
2464,"Moe, gimme a beer."
2465,"Put it in the fridge, Moe. I got a date with my wife."
2466,RAINDROPS KEEP FALLING ON MY HEAD...
2467,"It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life."
2468,I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big.
2469,Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. That's where I got this scar.
2470,Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito?
2471,Then I got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
2472,Thanks a lot Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought.
2473,"If we give up our dental plan, I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces."
2474,"People stop! We can't give up our dental plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth."
2475,"And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan?"
2476,You know what I think of this contract?
2477,"Hey, what does this job pay?"
2478,Woo hoo!
2479,And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime.
2480,Mmm. Gratzi.
2481,Eh-Eh-Eh.
2482,Molto bene.
2483,That's-a-nice-a-donut.
2484,"Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me."
2485,"Done and done! Heh, heh, heh."
2486,"Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?"
2487,"Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no."
2488,Who is it?
2489,Who?
2490,Hired goons?
2491,"You know, you could have just called me."
2492,Hired goons?
2493,"Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms."
2494,Which way to the bathroom?
2495,Nope. Nope. Nope.
2496,Uh... yeah.
2497,I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place.
2498,"Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh..."
2499,"Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head."
2500,"Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I've had enough."
2501,Who keeps saying that?
2502,Woo hoo!
2503,BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER...
2504,Woo hoo!
2505,"Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop!"
2506,We're going back to work!
2507,Haw haw. April Fool's.
2508,"Haw, haw. April Fool's! I've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker!"
2509,You talk better than you fool.
2510,You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.
2511,"Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day?"
2512,God bless those pagans.
2513,Happy New Year!
2514,And that's the story of April Fool's Day.
2515,"Oh, right."
2516,"Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will."
2517,"Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were."
2518,So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?
2519,Mmmm... beer.
2520,"ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT, GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM..."
2521,Marge!
2522,Arrrgh!
2523,Arrrgh!
2524,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."
2525,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --"
2526,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
2527,You guys must have been pretty worried about me.
2528,"This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."
2529,Shhhh! Just watch.
2530,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!"
2531,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
2532,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
2533,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly."
2534,"Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe."
2535,No! No! Beer bring pain!
2536,"Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed."
2537,Marge!
2538,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
2539,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.
2540,I can't.
2541,Mmm... chocolate.
2542,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
2543,"Mmmm, chocolate."
2544,"Can't breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...Mmm, nuts."
2545,"Oh, yeah."
2546,Oof.
2547,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
2548,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
2549,I thought maybe you...
2550,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
2551,No. Let me hear you play.
2552,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?"
2553,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE..."
2554,"OVER THERE."""
2555,Why you little...
2556,What the...
2557,They're fine.
2558,"Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
2559,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
2560,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
2561,"Why, you little --"
2562,This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii!
2563,Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes!
2564,Me lose brain? Uh-oh.
2565,Why'd I laugh?
2566,"Marge, it happened again!"
2567,"Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom."
2568,"Marge, I never graduated from high school."
2569,"I never passed remedial science one ""A""."
2570,"Marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay."
2571,"I don't know. I flunked Latin, too."
2572,"Ah, my high school yearbook..."
2573,You handsome devil.
2574,I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
2575,"""Activities, none. Sports, none. Honors, none."" So many memories."
2576,"It'll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, ""The Fonz""..."
2577,"No, they weren't all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back."
2578,"Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown."
2579,Richard Nixon.
2580,I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
2581,Hmmm.
2582,"The guy's so high, he doesn't even know that's Dave."
2583,"Homer's not here, man."
2584,Ed Sullivan.
2585,Oh my God!
2586,I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
2587,Yes!
2588,What can I say? It hasn't been easy staying in my rut...
2589,"Marge, I have my pride. I'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!"
2590,"Bart, Lisa I have something to tell you, and I'm not proud of it."
2591,I never graduated from high school.
2592,"Oh, you have a job?"
2593,I see.
2594,"All right. But if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar."
2595,Will this be on the test?
2596,Nooooooo!
2597,This is not happening. This is not happening.
2598,True.
2599,True.
2600,False.
2601,"All right, brain, you don't like me and I don't like you. But let's just do this and I can get back to killing you with beer."
2602,It's a deal!
2603,Marge! I passed!
2604,At our next high school reunion I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
2605,"Hello, Dondelinger."
2606,Not me!
2607,Hey kids. How was school?
2608,That's my boy.
2609,"Mmmm, beer... What?"
2610,No son of mine is gonna be a 19th Century Cockney bootblack. We're gonna find you another school.
2611,"Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one."
2612,What's your problem?
2613,Woo hoo! The greatest day of the year.
2614,"Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved."
2615,"Look what I got, Marge. A new whacking stick."
2616,Whack!
2617,Whack! Whack! Whack!
2618,"Yes, honey."
2619,Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. Remember that?
2620,Your Daddy hit the referee.
2621,Yeah.
2622,Here you go. Official Whacking Day parking. Ten dollars per axle.
2623,Woo hoo!
2624,"Well, Marge,"
2625,should I whack slow or fast?
2626,Uh-oh.
2627,"Lisa, maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions. Now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn?"
2628,You mean there's a better way?
2629,"Gotta get a juicer. Gonna drink juice, lose weight. Won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore."
2630,Oh my Juice Loosener's never gonna come.
2631,Woo-Hoo!
2632,My name is Mr. Burns.
2633,"Marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head."
2634,"But, I'll miss ""Sheriff Lobo."""
2635,I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...
2636,I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...
2637,Lobooo...
2638,Lobooo...
2639,"Look, Marge, I'll just talk to Apu and I'm sure he'll be reasonable."
2640,"Apu, I'd like you to drop the charges against my wife."
2641,"Now, come on! I'm your best customer."
2642,Mmm... pie.
2643,"Marge, I'm gonna miss you so much. And it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. But mostly, I'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning."
2644,"Marge, please. I'm having enough trouble with the lobsters."
2645,"Now kids, while your mother's gone, I don't wanna have to wash any dishes. So, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet."
2646,"We're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course."
2647,Go up to the attic. There's a whole trunk of clothes up there.
2648,Uh... no.
2649,"Honey, I don't know what you're feelin' right now. So I don't wanna push anything. We can just hold hands... or sit and talk..."
2650,Woo!
2651,He's dead now.
2652,Yeah.
2653,I figure it's some guy's name. Some guy named Gabbo.
2654,I'll figure it out. I'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
2655,He'll tell us what to do.
2656,WITH MY...
2657,"Two wrongs make a right, Lisa. Ah, Rex Morgan M.D., you have the prescription for the daily blues."
2658,"Hey, Moe, can I look too?"
2659,My wallet's in the car.
2660,"Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. You can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out."
2661,"Oh, wait. That was the old sofa."
2662,"Ooh, delicious."
2663,"Ooh, five cents each!"
2664,Junk... junk... the airplane's upside down... Strad-i-who-vius?...
2665,"I'm surprised you don't remember, son. It was only eight years ago."
2666,"Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... A maturing Joe Piscopo left ""Saturday Night Live"" to conquer Hollywood... People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and I was in a barbershop quartet..."
2667,Hello...
2668,"Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild."
2669,"Bart, what did I tell you?"
2670,"Rock 'n' roll had become stagnant. ""Achy Breaky Heart"" was seven years away. Something had to fill the void, and that something was barbershop..."
2671,GOODBYE...
2672,SO GOODBYE...
2673,Really?
2674,Just leave it to me.
2675,"Run along, boy. You're free now!"
2676,"The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement..."
2677,Get off the stage!
2678,It was one lousy applicant after another. And then...
2679,"Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?"
2680,The Be Sharps.
2681,What'd you kids get?
2682,"Far out, man. I haven't seen a bong in years."
2683,"Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire."
2684,"It'll be a long time before your Mother gets back with the tire, so why don't I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit. Something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's..."
2685,THERE WAS NOTHING IN AL CAPONE'S VAULT / BUT IT WASN'T GERALDO'S FAULT --
2686,Hmm... baby on board.
2687,"BABY ON BOARD / SOMETHING, SOMETHING BURT WARD... This thing writes itself!"
2688,Wait'll I tell Marge!
2689,"Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand."
2690,"Come on, honey. It'll only be till we finish our tour of Sweden."
2691,"Yeah, but I'm not gonna let it change our lives. I'll be the same loving father I've always been."
2692,I stuck him somewhere.
2693,"Look what I got for you, Dad."
2694,"We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons."
2695,I meant the statue.
2696,We had fame and fortune.
2697,Now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes.
2698,Then came the greatest thrill of my life.
2699,Oh my God. Oh my God! Where did you get that brownie?
2700,Oh man.
2701,"Lisa, did you see the Grammys?"
2702,"Well, you haven't heard the last of them."
2703,"I miss you too, honey."
2704,Oh. Thanks.
2705,Here.
2706,"They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart!"
2707,All the time. It was the title of our second album!
2708,But we were about to learn an iron law of show business: What goes up must come down.
2709,"Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--"
2710,Shut up!
2711,"Hi, kids... I love"
2712,"Meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own..."
2713,I pity the fool who doesn't like... he. And wher's Barney?
2714,Then came the day we knew we were finished.
2715,Are we hot?
2716,We all went our separate ways.
2717,"Hey, fellas! I'm back."
2718,I'll give her a good home.
2719,And I did.
2720,I'll never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top.
2721,"There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed."
2722,"I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and I hope we passed the audition."
2723,"Oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! Oh wait, it's for Bart."
2724,"Oh. I wrote that one, after Bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt."
2725,It's probably the person you least suspect!
2726,Yeah.
2727,"If you don't mind, we're trying to watch the mov..."
2728,Oh no!
2729,"Is that so? Oh, Flan-ders! Won't you join me in my kitchen?"
2730,Go home.
2731,"Woo hoo! Did you hear, Bart? Oh."
2732,Ooh! I wanna be John Elway.
2733,Woo hoo!
2734,"Whup, two against one!"
2735,This isn't just because of Sideshow Bob. It's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.
2736,"Shut up, boy."
2737,"Ooh, Ice Creamville."
2738,Check.
2739,I got ya.
2740,No problem.
2741,I think he's talking to you.
2742,EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN...
2743,Lousy speed bumps.
2744,Ew. This coffee's too hot.
2745,"Hey, kids! Wanna drive through that cactus patch?"
2746,"Wow, a houseboat! You know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else."
2747,"I tied him up, out back."
2748,"Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left."
2749,Aaah...
2750,Bart! Don't interrupt!
2751,Oh it is not.
2752,BARTDOYOUWANTSOMEBROWNIESBEFORE YOUGOTOBED?!
2753,"C'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they're still hot."
2754,"Why? Oh, right. The Sideshow Bob thing. Sorry, boy."
2755,Nope.
2756,BARTDOYOUWANNASEEMYNEWCHAINSAWAND HOCKEYMASK?
2757,Sorry. What am I thinking?
2758,"Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies."
2759,"Aw, no fair."
2760,"Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee."
2761,You guys are pathetic. No wonder Smithers made me Head Bee Guy.
2762,The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom's big! Oh!
2763,What the hell are you talking about?
2764,What do I do!? What do I do!? In the name of God you've got to tell me!
2765,Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.
2766,"Must destroy mankind! Ohh, lunch time."
2767,So you want me to go to college?
2768,Bart!
2769,"Maybe you're right. I did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way."
2770,That dog has somebody's ham! This I gotta see!
2771,"C'mon! Gimme the hand, you stupid dog! C'mon! Gimme' that!"
2772,"Is ""TV Guide"" a book?"
2773,Son of Sniglets??
2774,"Katharine Hepburn's ""Me""?"
2775,I suck.
2776,... it was the most I ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.
2777,"Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch..."
2778,"Relax, a photo can't make any difference."
2779,"Sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that I really should watch."
2780,I hate that lousy dean!
2781,"Yes! Take that, Bitterman!"
2782,Woo hoo! A flyer for a hardware store!
2783,Something I should have done a long time ago...
2784,"No, ma'am."
2785,"Woo hoo, I'm a college man! I won't need my high school diploma anymore."
2786,I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART. S-M-R-T...I MEAN S-M-A-R-T.
2787,My first day of college. I wish my father was alive to see this.
2788,How long have you been back there?
2789,Nerd!
2790,"Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
2791,"Hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?"
2792,I'll be a campus hero...
2793,"Marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. And unless movies and TV have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!"
2794,"Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
2795,Hold me.
2796,"You see that, sir. Drops his notes."
2797,Do we have to?
2798,Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
2799,"Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. Besides, it isn't costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site."
2800,"Uh, excuse me ""Professor Brainiac,"" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works."
2801,"All right, I will."
2802,"In there, guys."
2803,"Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war isn't over."
2804,"Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head."
2805,"Hiya, gang!"
2806,"Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor..."
2807,"Heh heh. ""Nee."""
2808,We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf.
2809,You take that back...
2810,Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
2811,"Oh, not Souter... Oh, no."
2812,I'll write it on my hand...
2813,"C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
2814,We're gonna go out and par-ty!
2815,"Aah, the college road trip. What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem?"
2816,"But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good..."
2817,"I'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean'll go nuts!"
2818,"I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge."
2819,Those bastards...
2820,And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
2821,What?
2822,"Look! You pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight..."
2823,"Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly..."
2824,Ow! Why you little...
2825,"Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled..."
2826,"Hey, that's not the wallet inspector."
2827,"Marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. They'll solve all our problems. They'll elevate us to the status of kings on Earth."
2828,"Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge?"
2829,Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
2830,I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
2831,Perfect.
2832,"Well, dean, I'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank."
2833,And all those other pranks were my idea too. I'm the one who should be expelled.
2834,"Yes, you have."
2835,"No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
2836,"Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams."
2837,"Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out."
2838,Whatever. Either way is good...
2839,I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.
2840,Computers can do that?
2841,Mora wuza?
2842,"Oh, let's just say I had help from a ""little magic box..."""
2843,"Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
2844,Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
2845,"Hmmm, true."
2846,"Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean."
2847,"Well, I guess it's back to college for me. And that means it's time to... What did I teach you guys?"
2848,Yes.
2849,Lobo! Lobo! Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo!
2850,Oh no! Burns' Birthday!
2851,Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.
2852,Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow!
2853,Not funny. And the one in my pants really hurt.
2854,Hee hee! I'm so funny! This is gonna be great.
2855,I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?
2856,"Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants."
2857,Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...
2858,"Lisa, don't spoil our fun!"
2859,"Okay, stupid!"
2860,"Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!"
2861,Are you ready to laugh?
2862,I said are you ready to laugh?!
2863,"You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap..."
2864,I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...
2865,"Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky."
2866,"I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah."
2867,"I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah."
2868,"Blah, bla..."
2869,Unghhhh!
2870,"Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again."
2871,"Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday."
2872,"Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down."
2873,Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!
2874,Right. That makes sense.
2875,No! Lemme go!
2876,How long have we had these fish? Wait! The bear! Burns' bear!
2877,"Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio."
2878,"Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun..."
2879,Yes. We'll send the eye.
2880,Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
2881,"Sorry, Burns. No deal."
2882,I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink!
2883,I knew you'd come crawling back.
2884,"A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones."
2885,Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go.
2886,It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie!
2887,"Here you go, Maggie."
2888,"The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here."
2889,"Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay."
2890,Hmmm. Sixty-four slices of American cheese.
2891,Sixty four... sixty three...
2892,I think I'm blind.
2893,Right here.
2894,My life can't get any worse.
2895,After lunch can I whip you?
2896,"Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!"
2897,See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do...
2898,Do do do do doo...
2899,No! My box! My box!
2900,"Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money."
2901,"Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul."
2902,Box...
2903,I can see why this is so popular.
2904,That's right.
2905,"Oh, Barney, leave me alone."
2906,"Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers!"
2907,I love this show
2908,"Well well, look whose come to apologize."
2909,"But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's."
2910,"Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?"
2911,"Oooh, pure genius..."
2912,Oh. Pure genius. And now to make the leap from dreams to reality.
2913,All right. Stay calm. Remember your training.
2914,"Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency donut. Signed, Homer. Bastard. He's always one step ahead. Oh, I'd sell my soul for a donut!"
2915,Flanders! You're the devil?
2916,Do you have a donut or not?
2917,"Hey, wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?"
2918,I'm smarter than the de-vil! I'm smarter than the dev-
2919,"Not likely. Heh, heh."
2920,Mmmm... forbidden donut.
2921,No.
2922,"Eh, that wasn't so bad."
2923,"Uh, huh."
2924,More. Mmmm.
2925,No.
2926,Woo hoo! Ow!
2927,"But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work."
2928,"Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! It was just sitting in some guy's boat!"
2929,Hey boy!
2930,They're dogs! And they're playing poker!
2931,"Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos."
2932,Hmmm... business deal.
2933,It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... Pennsylvania.
2934,Sure did.
2935,"Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer."
2936,It was the boy!
2937,"Huh, ooooh, punch!"
2938,Correction. Free blood.
2939,Ahhh.
2940,"Oh, Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. Now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and TV... is."
2941,Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire.
2942,Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?
2943,Super Fun Happy Slide!
2944,I guess killing will be fun enough.
2945,"Take that, vile fiend!"
2946,"Oh, sorry."
2947,You have to kill the head vampire.
2948,What the hell's so funny?
2949,Stupid TV. Be more funny.
2950,"Heh, heh, some idiot actually called in!"
2951,"Marge, it's public TV! They never have anything good. Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-es?"
2952,The ballet? Woo hoo!
2953,"Marjorie, please. I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. Ahhh, ballet."
2954,"All right, but remember it's mine."
2955,That's what ballet is?
2956,"Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum."
2957,"Heh, heh, heh. It was worth it."
2958,I can't. I gotta take my wife to the ballet.
2959,Mmmm... invisible cola.
2960,"Heh, heh. Time to stick it to the man."
2961,"Phht, that's just an old wives tale."
2962,Errrrghh... just...a little more. Got it!
2963,I'm stuck! Help me!
2964,Must... get to ballet...
2965,promised Marge...
2966,Hello? Can I get some help? Snack related mishap!
2967,"Mmmmm, candy."
2968,"Marge, this may be hard to believe, but I'm trapped inside two vending machines."
2969,I'm going to have these things on my arms forever!
2970,Candy and sodas for all!
2971,Mmmm... convenient.
2972,"They'll grow back, right?"
2973,Your point being?
2974,"Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. That's why I had the fireman write me a note."
2975,Lumber has a million uses.
2976,"Marge, that's twice. I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman."
2977,"Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it's doing it again!"
2978,"Marge, you can't go out on Saturday. That's our special night."
2979,"What the... Oh, I don't know... a little show called ""Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman""?!"
2980,Where you going?
2981,When will you be home?
2982,Where you going?
2983,Will you bring me back something?
2984,"How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children?"
2985,"Man's best friend, indeed."
2986,I can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.
2987,"Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?"
2988,That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
2989,Fine! I can have a great time all by myself!
2990,"Oh Lisa, haven't you seen ""Home Alone?"" If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation."
2991,Wait a second...
2992,You kids do need a baby-sitter.
2993,Here you g... Nnnnnno.
2994,We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.
2995,Two.
2996,Done.
2997,Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
2998,Hi guys!
2999,"Moe, get the darts. I want to play."
3000,"Ooooh, ""Jet!"""
3001,Woo hoo! It's Garret Morris' birthday.
3002,Come on Marge. It's fun to smash things. I smashed it good!
3003,You got real purdy hair.
3004,"Ah, young love."
3005,The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I'll bash it good!
3006,It's just no fun without Marge.
3007,My wife's having a girls' night out.
3008,"I miss you, Marge."
3009,A lot of blue hair? Heh-heh. What a freak.
3010,"It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal, just because I didn't take her to the ballet."
3011,Really?
3012,That's them!
3013,Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!
3014,Marge! Marge!
3015,"Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I'm sorry... Oh well let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point."
3016,"But please Marge, don't drive into that chasm!"
3017,"Solid waste, I could kiss you."
3018,"Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza."
3019,Woo hoo!
3020,Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.
3021,"Ahh, the daily newspaper."
3022,Oooh! The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!
3023,OH MY GOD!
3024,Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!
3025,"Oh no, you don't! That trampoline is MINE."
3026,Huh?
3027,Krusty!
3028,Yeah. What's the deal?
3029,And I can just haul it away? Free?
3030,"Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son."
3031,"Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!"
3032,Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.
3033,No it doesn't!
3034,"Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump."
3035,"Okay, okay. I'll take care of it."
3036,"All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!"
3037,"Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the..."
3038,There we go.
3039,That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
3040,"Yep, it's finally gone."
3041,"If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now."
3042,I'm thirsty.
3043,"Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline."
3044,"All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
3045,Rust I tell ya.
3046,Uh-huh.
3047,"Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!"
3048,Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
3049,That's not fun!
3050,"See, Marge?"
3051,"What up, Marge?"
3052,"Marge, can I go outside and play?"
3053,And that sends me into a shame spiral.
3054,"Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now."
3055,And I feel that you hear my shame.
3056,I feel validated by that.
3057,Me too.
3058,"Wow! For free, ""SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM."""
3059,"Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?"
3060,"Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture."
3061,"I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar."
3062,Food goes in here.
3063,It sure does!
3064,"Thank you. Very, very much."
3065,This is great. I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man.
3066,"Hey, I hear ya, buddy."
3067,"Hey, boy! In here!"
3068,"Hold on, son."
3069,"So long, suckers!"
3070,"No, we're not."
3071,"Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone."
3072,That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.
3073,"Oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time."
3074,"Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain."
3075,"It means he gets results, you stupid chief."
3076,"Oh, I'm sorry."
3077,"Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites."
3078,"""Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" Mmmmm."
3079,Steak?
3080,Steak?
3081,Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
3082,Uh oh. Something's wrong.
3083,"Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha!"
3084,"Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut."
3085,Explain how.
3086,Woo hoo!
3087,Mmmmm... free goo.
3088,"Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel."
3089,"Well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons."
3090,"You're right, Marge. Good work, boy."
3091,Egghead likes his bookie wook!
3092,Just tucking him in.
3093,"Oooh, floor pie."
3094,Hmm.
3095,BART!!!! Mmm... apple.
3096,"Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart."
3097,"How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh?"
3098,Stupid poetic justice...!
3099,Heh heh. You don't have a son.
3100,"I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes."
3101,"Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip."
3102,"Bart, I'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!"
3103,I'll take it.
3104,Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders. Please not Flanders.
3105,You are not my son.
3106,"Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible."
3107,"Hey, there's a new Mexico."
3108,So many Krustyburger locations.
3109,"Wrong again, Flanders."
3110,"In a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land."
3111,SUGAR. DO DO DO DO DO DO AWWW. HO--NEY. HO.....NEYYY. DO DO DO DO DO DO. / YOU ARE MY CANDY GIRRRRL Lousy piece of junk!
3112,Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!
3113,"Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? ""Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink."""
3114,Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed!
3115,"Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!"
3116,"Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing."
3117,"Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so:"
3118,Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life.
3119,"This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing..."
3120,"All right, well that's okay. When they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us."
3121,Flanders! Snap out of it!
3122,It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry.
3123,You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.
3124,He'll be back.
3125,"Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We're waiting."
3126,"Son, there's something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now."
3127,I stole it from that Borgnine guy.
3128,Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...
3129,The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.
3130,According to this map there's a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
3131,Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn't much time!
3132,Give seven hundred Krustyburgers!
3133,Go away. Eating.
3134,"Watch this, guys."
3135,And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.
3136,I mean... you know if we wanted to... not that I... ever did.
3137,Hi.
3138,Gotta go.
3139,What the hell was that? I probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy I found in the parking lot.
3140,"Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens."
3141,You too. No goose bumps. No hallucinations. That last time was just a fluke.
3142,"So uh, what do you guys think of Mindy?"
3143,Yeah. That Mindy seems real nice.
3144,Mindy has a motorcycle.
3145,"Moe, I need your advice."
3146,"See, I got this friend named... Joey Joe Joe Junior... Schabadoo."
3147,"Oh, what the hell, it's me. I'm attracted to another woman. What am I going to do?"
3148,Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?
3149,"Uh, so. Let's have a conversation. Uh, I think we'll find we have very little in common."
3150,"Hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze."
3151,"Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV."
3152,Me too.
3153,"Foul temptress! I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too."
3154,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
3155,I mean hello!
3156,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator."
3157,That's unsexy.
3158,Ew.
3159,"Well, this is my floor."
3160,Arr - see ya tomorrow.
3161,"Ah, home to my loving family. What more can a man ask for?"
3162,Uhhh.
3163,"Hi, son. Howya... ewww."
3164,"Yeah, good."
3165,"Let's have a little quality time together, just you and me."
3166,Hey! We haven't watched TV in awhile.
3167,Hello hotline? I am very tempted by another woman.
3168,Nooo!
3169,Who are you?
3170,Sir Isa-who?
3171,Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters?
3172,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp?"
3173,"Ooh, I would live in a big mansion?"
3174,"I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves?"
3175,Then we're all happy.
3176,Marge lives here?
3177,"OH MINDY, YOU CAME AND YOU GAVE WITHOUT FLAKING. BUT I SENT YOU BEN-GAY, OH ANDY, YOU KISSED ME AND STOPPED ME FROM SOMETHING, AND I..."
3178,Uh oh.
3179,"Um, because I have a small role in a Broadway musical. It's not much, but it's a start."
3180,Like what?
3181,"Lisa, look out behind you!"
3182,"No, Lisa, I swear to you. I'm one-hundred percent completely serious. You've got to turn around right now before it's too late."
3183,Sucker.
3184,"Mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, I think we should avoid each other from now on."
3185,Mindy!
3186,Oh no! I'm sweating like Roger Ebert.
3187,"Uh, Murphy, you are elf a controllably I think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo."
3188,"Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me?"
3189,Heh heh heh. Did you know Kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?
3190,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it."
3191,Free mouthwash! Free shampoo! Free shower curtain!
3192,Mindy?
3193,"Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. Heh heh."
3194,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
3195,Oh!
3196,"Oh. Something's missing. Ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed."
3197,Mmmm... foot long chili dog.
3198,It's a sign!
3199,Go to hell!
3200,"Heh, you know, I was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but I think as long as we're not alone together..."
3201,Huh?
3202,Is there any way to get out of this?
3203,Oh yeah.
3204,Well I guess you'll want to come in.
3205,Okay.
3206,"Yeah, yeah."
3207,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.
3208,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
3209,But they're so sweet.
3210,"Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about Marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. Sometimes I'd just like to..."
3211,"Oh, baby."
3212,Mmmm... Marge.
3213,"OH, MARGIE, YOU CAME AND YOU FOUND ME A TURKEY, ON MY VACATION AWAY FROM WORKEY..."
3214,"Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day."
3215,Anybody lose their glasses? Last chance. Woo hoo!
3216,The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.
3217,"Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do."
3218,And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.
3219,Shhh. I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
3220,"I got a job at Burns' casino. As you know, it's been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer."
3221,We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.
3222,"Uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. Dealer busts. Looks like you all win again."
3223,"Why thanks, Senator! Oop, looks like my shift is over."
3224,"Hey, Marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, I bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino."
3225,"Strike three, Marge. I remember that meeting, and I have a photographic memory."
3226,Y'ello?
3227,And then I said to the president... get this Marge? Marge?
3228,Twenty- one? Do that card-counting thing again! Come on. Do it again.
3229,"No! Please, please, please, please, please..."
3230,No!
3231,"Marge, you waited for me."
3232,"Okay, Marge, let's go."
3233,"Marge, I'm taking the car."
3234,This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
3235,Marge...
3236,"Wait. I see what's happening here. You're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. Well, that's just sad."
3237,"You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Collins Mix, frozen pie crust."
3238,"Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom."
3239,"Marge, we need to talk. You're spending too much time at the casino, and I think you may have a problem..."
3240,Woo hoo! Problem solved!
3241,Huh? Wuh? Lisa? What's up?
3242,"Aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it."
3243,Boogeyman?! You nail the windows shut! I'll get the gun!
3244,"Bart, I don't want to alarm you, but there may be a Boogeyman or Boogeymen in the house!"
3245,"Oh, nothing, Marge. Just a little incident involving the Boogeyman. Of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid."
3246,Aw. Just like on TV.
3247,"Lisa, your mom still loves you. It's just that she has a career, now. She's a slot jockey."
3248,"It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this."
3249,Ow...ow...ow...ow.
3250,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
3251,"Oh yeah, the costume."
3252,"Hello, Floreeda."
3253,"No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws."
3254,Marge! Where are you?! Damn this casino! Damn this casino!
3255,Can't talk now.
3256,You broke a promise to your child.
3257,"You promised Lisa to help her with her costume. You made her cry, then I cried. Then Maggie laughed. She's such a little trooper."
3258,"Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem."
3259,"No no, that's too expensive. Just don't do it anymore."
3260,Can't talk. Robbed. Go hell.
3261,"You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem."
3262,Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?
3263,"Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus?"
3264,"Well, you have a gambling problem!"
3265,"Aw, what a gyp."
3266,And remember when I...
3267,Oh yeah. I forgot already.
3268,Woo hoo!
3269,"Eh, that's no big loss."
3270,"Oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em."
3271,"Shhh, quiet Lisa."
3272,"Curse you, Magic Beans."
3273,"Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I wish to report a robbery!"
3274,Let me check my reason list.
3275,Yep. It's on here.
3276,"Alright, these are our new family security rules: Be home before dark, and make sure you're not followed, lock all doors and windows."
3277,"Marge, they're only human."
3278,"Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got you another instrument."
3279,"Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down."
3280,"Aw, honey. I didn't realize how much that horn meant to you. Don't worry. Daddy's gonna get it back. I don't know how, but I'll figure out something."
3281,"You know Lisa, music helps daddy think."
3282,I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?
3283,I'm someone else!
3284,"We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who'll act without considering the consequences."
3285,"Sorry, Dad. You're too old."
3286,"Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. Aren't they? Aren't they? Huh? Yes they are. Yes they are..."
3287,"Marge, we're responsible adults and..."
3288,... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
3289,"Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I'll be ""Cueball."" Skinner can be ""Eightball"", Barney will be ""Twelveball,"" and Moe, you can be ""Cueball."""
3290,"No, we're forming a vigilante group."
3291,Put this in your pipe and smoke it.
3292,Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
3293,"Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs!"
3294,Sorry.
3295,"Okay, men, it's time to clean up this town."
3296,"You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
3297,"Bart, give me that megaphone of yours."
3298,Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.
3299,Move along there.
3300,Return to your homes and places of businesses!
3301,"Hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?"
3302,Get him!
3303,No burning leaves without a permit!
3304,Too late.
3305,"You better have a good reason for doing that, boy."
3306,You're in. Here's the sack.
3307,"So I said to him, ""Look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that."""
3308,I 'unno. Coast Guard?
3309,"Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas."
3310,Literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination...
3311,"Oh, that might be a typo."
3312,"Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that."
3313,"Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes."
3314,Y'ello.
3315,Uh... Marge?
3316,Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!
3317,Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.
3318,"Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time."
3319,We'll be right back.
3320,"Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything."
3321,Hey!
3322,He'll show.
3323,It's his job.
3324,He's a burglar.
3325,"Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? There's just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
3326,Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep! I was drunk!
3327,"Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do."
3328,Nooooo!
3329,"Oh, this doesn't work any more."
3330,I didn't say stop.
3331,"Aw, Dad, I could kiss you."
3332,No wait! I know where the burglar is!
3333,"So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him."
3334,"Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa."
3335,I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat burglar. That means you. You are the cat burglar.
3336,Shut up.
3337,No kidding.
3338,"Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and... sleep."
3339,Lemme through! I gotta find a Big T. There's millions of dollars buried under a Big T!
3340,It's mine!
3341,"""Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. I have already used this time to escape from your jail. Fondest wishes."" Oh, I can't make out this signature."
3342,We'll dig our way out!
3343,"Ahh, the morning horoscope. ""Today will be a day like every other day."" It just gets worse and worse."
3344,"Yeah, you kids gotta go to school. I gotta go to work. The only one who has it easy is Marge."
3345,"Buzz off, Giuseppe."
3346,"Just a minute! Don't hang up! Y'ello... you'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel."
3347,What do you mean you lost him?! He might have fallen into one of these machines!
3348,Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!
3349,He's a box! My boy's a box! Damn you! A boooxxx!
3350,"Marge, I have some horrible, bone chilling news."
3351,"Oh, nothing."
3352,That's not a job. It's a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!
3353,Why not? I remember my first after-school job. I was in a band.
3354,"Hello, everybody. I'm Archie Bell and I'm also the Drells. We got a new song called, 'Tighten Up' and this is the music you tighten up with."
3355,"Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man."
3356,"Gig, son. When you're a musician, a job is called a gig."
3357,"It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters."
3358,"Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today."
3359,"There, there."
3360,Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that uniform.
3361,"Come on, Lisa. Say something funny."
3362,"Oh, something stupid like Bart would say. Bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. Something like that."
3363,"Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about Urkel... that little snot. Boy I'd like to smack that kid."
3364,What the hell are you readin' books for?
3365,"Don't forget to say ""I didn't do it""."
3366,How do you figure boy?
3367,"All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out you know."
3368,That dog can sell anything.
3369,What kind of catchphrase is that?
3370,Woo hoo! Cheap meat!
3371,"Oooh, this one's open!"
3372,"Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... Not much time. Must finish."
3373,Your old meat made me sick!
3374,This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
3375,Woo hoo!
3376,Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?
3377,Bor-ing.
3378,"Shhhh, Lisa. The dog is barking."
3379,"No way, man No way, man. Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire."
3380,"Oh, that I'll wear."
3381,"Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat."
3382,Bee? Aah!
3383,One hot dog please.
3384,"It's true, it's true. We're so lame."
3385,"No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware! I WAS UNAWAAARE!"
3386,Oh.
3387,You're selling what now?
3388,You can't sell that. Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
3389,Is he still out there?
3390,What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping...
3391,"Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?"
3392,"Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a... Apu, what do you call this thing again?"
3393,Outrageous.
3394,"Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there."
3395,Pass the chutney.
3396,That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
3397,Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
3398,Ub. Apu friend me good.
3399,That's okay.
3400,THAT KWIK-E-MART'S A REAL... .
3401,Everything really wrapped up nicely. Much quicker than usual.
3402,And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.
3403,"Hey, what's that sound?"
3404,"Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song. I hate when people do that."
3405,"I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do... Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing. But I'll go you one better and come along."
3406,Okay.
3407,I'm aware of that.
3408,Are we in India yet?
3409,Are we in India yet?
3410,Are we in India yet?
3411,Are we in India yet?
3412,This isn't very convenient.
3413,Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
3414,Really?
3415,You?
3416,Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
3417,"No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours."
3418,"Okay, Apu, I accept your apology."
3419,"Fine. Oh, I mean not good."
3420,"Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead."
3421,"Hey, let's all hug Apu."
3422,"Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again."
3423,Woo hoo!
3424,"Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them."
3425,"Look, Maggie! It's Sgt. Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, complete with Death-bringer missiles that really launch!"
3426,"Ah, come on, Marge, you're way too..."
3427,"ONE, TWO, THREE O'CLOCK, FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN O'CLOCK, EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK!.."
3428,"ROCK! ROCK! ROCK! ROCK-A, ROCK, ROCK! ROCKAROCKROCK!"
3429,"WE'RE GONNA ROCK, GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TO-NIGHHHTTT!"
3430,"Thank you, thank you very much!"
3431,"Marge, that's what I bought it for!"
3432,Yes. But there's more.
3433,"Dad, I love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya."
3434,And we can't watch Fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in Syria.
3435,"I'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. Everyone listens to me! No matter how dumb my suggestions are."
3436,How about me?
3437,I'unno.
3438,"Marge, Lisa, Lady -- If you'll excuse me, I've got something very important to attend to."
3439,Hey.
3440,"Hello. Well, today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time."
3441,"Union rule twenty-six - ""Every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."""
3442,Inanimate huh? I'll show him inanimate!
3443,Stupid carbon rod. It's all just a popularity contest.
3444,Nobody respects me at work.
3445,"What, what does it say? I want to see."
3446,"Ah, TV respects me. It laughs with me, not at me."
3447,Boring.
3448,"No, the batteries!"
3449,Make it stop!
3450,I can't! I can't!
3451,"Hello, is this NASA?"
3452,"Good. Listen, I'm sick of your boring space launches. Now I'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but I know what I likes on TV..."
3453,Shut up. And another thing - how come I can't get no Tang 'round here? And also... hold on a second.
3454,"Hello, is this President Clinton? Good. I figured if anyone knew where to get some Tang it'd be you... shut up!"
3455,"No. It wasn't me, I swear. It was... him."
3456,"Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE."
3457,"I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes. ...Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty... That was our planet. You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to hell."
3458,I'll take care of this.
3459,And may the best man win. He's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. Meet me up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.
3460,Less shame?
3461,Who's doin' what now?
3462,"Well here I am, right on time. I don't see Barney ""Let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-White-House-and-kill-the-President"" Gumbel."
3463,"Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. There once was a man from Nantucket"
3464,I can't stands no more.
3465,Mmmmm. Mediciney.
3466,"Ahem... I uh... don't think this contest is over yet, Buzz. If that is your real name. I believe there Is still a little something called the swimsuit competition."
3467,You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
3468,"Congratulations, Barney."
3469,Default? Woo hoo! The two sweetest words in the English language. De-fault! De-fault! De-
3470,Nooooo!
3471,"Marge, I don't really want to go through with this... But being an astronaut is how I got you to respect me."
3472,Oh.
3473,Ants!
3474,"You're right, Marge. Just like the time I could've met Mr. T at the mall. The entire day, I kept saying, I'll go a little later, I'll go a little later.' And then when I got there, they told me he just left. And when I asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. Well, I'm never gonna let something like that happen again. I'm going into space, right now."
3475,Are we there yet? I'm thirsty.
3476,It's beautiful. It's the most awe inspiring sight I have ever seen.
3477,"... giver of life, mother of us all."
3478,"Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard."
3479,Wow! Former president James Taylor.
3480,And that is that.
3481,No!
3482,Wait a minute Race! Wait a minute. Wait!...Ah-ha! Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours.
3483,Stupid bar.
3484,I'll bash you good.
3485,"OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ CRISPY CRUNCHY GRAHAM CEREAL BRAND NEW BREAKFAST TREAT."
3486,Stupid rod. I got gypped.
3487,"Yeah, maybe I do have the right... what's that stuff? Anyway, thanks, Marge, Lisa."
3488,"See because of me, now they have a warning."
3489,Woo hoo! Sold!
3490,"What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig."
3491,"I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore."
3492,"Heh-heh-heh, I did it. Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work."
3493,"In theory, yes. Jerk."
3494,Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!
3495,Oh stupid sheep.
3496,"Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders."
3497,I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE...
3498,Excellent guitar riff.
3499,Why am I such a loser? Why?
3500,"Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts."
3501,"God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game."
3502,"Why do you mock me, oh Lord?"
3503,I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm... sacri-licious.
3504,Huh?
3505,Y- No.
3506,"Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game with you."
3507,"Well, yeah."
3508,Duck! I can't let the boys see me with you!
3509,Hi.
3510,Yeah.
3511,"Hey everybody, here comes fun!"
3512,Heh heh. Ow.
3513,"Well, I guess I should pay my share..."
3514,"Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned."
3515,"NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN."
3516,"If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan ""The Boy"" Taylor."
3517,"We won! We won! Flanders, we won!"
3518,"Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!"
3519,I am invincible! Invincible!
3520,Ow!
3521,"Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks!"
3522,It was him!
3523,You know Stan Taylor?
3524,Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.
3525,"Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. You will be called ""Stitch-face."" Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me."
3526,No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend!
3527,"Marge, quit livin' in the past."
3528,I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.
3529,"Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese."
3530,Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.
3531,Boring. Let's watch something else.
3532,Yeah.
3533,Hey what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish.
3534,"Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family."
3535,Hey everyone!
3536,"I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend."
3537,Can't talk... see Flanders... later sex.
3538,"Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?"
3539,"Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya."
3540,But... all right.
3541,C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
3542,"Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays."
3543,"Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that."
3544,"Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
3545,"Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love."
3546,"The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend."
3547,Yes way.
3548,"Don't worry, I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape. It always makes the trip go faster."
3549,"Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot."
3550,"More. No, no, keep comin'. More... more... right there! Let her go!"
3551,"Okay, let's go boating!"
3552,They're fine.
3553,"I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons."
3554,"So, here's to my best friend, Ned."
3555,Food fight!
3556,Whatcha doin'?
3557,Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
3558,Too late.
3559,"Humph, your car. Boy, what are the odds, huh?"
3560,"Marge! I think I hate Ted Koppel. No wait, I find him informative and witty. 'Nite."
3561,"Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?"
3562,"Right, no reporters."
3563,O-okay.
3564,"Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
3565,Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE!
3566,Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.
3567,"Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats."
3568,I live to give.
3569,"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me. There have been times when I've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. We'd already be there."
3570,"Right back atcha, buddy."
3571,Now how 'bout that game at the Pitch 'n Putt?
3572,"Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there."
3573,"Get lost, Flanders."
3574,"See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about. This place isn't..."
3575,"Hi, Mom."
3576,"I'd love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today."
3577,"Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. It's how drunk you get."
3578,"Push her down, son."
3579,"Oh dear God, no."
3580,I call the basement.
3581,All done.
3582,"Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories."
3583,"""Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter."" Ooooh, I'll never forget that episode!"
3584,Shazam.
3585,What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain?
3586,Use only in a well ventilated area.
3587,"Shove it, buddy."
3588,Nothing.
3589,Okay.
3590,Y'ello.
3591,Y'ello?
3592,He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
3593,"Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!"
3594,"We'll call you back! Bart! With ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. We could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love."
3595,"Lisa, go to your room."
3596,Wee!
3597,"Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore."
3598,"Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory."
3599,What's he yelling about?
3600,Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
3601,"Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel."
3602,"Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth."
3603,Shut up.
3604,"Plants, eh?"
3605,"Hey, any more arboretums around here?"
3606,That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!
3607,"Grooming him, eh?"
3608,I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.
3609,"Hey, what's with them?"
3610,"Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. ""Chain for elephant,"" ""Shots for elephant""... ""Oversized decorative poncho""."
3611,Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
3612,"Then that's what I'll do, smart guy."
3613,"For the ninth time, no!"
3614,"Wait a minute, this gives me an idea."
3615,"I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son."
3616,Your kid flew five feet. That counts as a ride. Two bucks.
3617,"Look at this, Marge! Fifty-eight dollars! And all of it profit! I'm the smartest businessman in the world!"
3618,"Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money."
3619,"Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once. Right?"
3620,"Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me."
3621,This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant.
3622,"Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him."
3623,"What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?"
3624,He likes peanuts.
3625,"I only have two questions. How much, and give it to me."
3626,"So, your bid is zero."
3627,Thank you.
3628,Thank you.
3629,"Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low."
3630,"Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant."
3631,Done.
3632,Here's the keys.
3633,I'll just keep these then.
3634,He took Bart too?
3635,"That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!"
3636,Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
3637,Stupid tornado. look. It got Patty and Selma.
3638,"Elephant, honey. It's an elephant. And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano."
3639,"Son, you're okay! And you've led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to..."
3640,Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
3641,I'd like it fine.
3642,"Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene..."
3643,Huh?
3644,"Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out."
3645,Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...
3646,I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
3647,"Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him."
3648,"On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products."
3649,All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
3650,Mmm. Caramel.
3651,Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.
3652,Woo hoo! What do I get?
3653,Woo hoo!
3654,"Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder."
3655,"That's it, boy. You're our last hope."
3656,"Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in."
3657,Oooh. He card reads good.
3658,"It's KURNS, stupid!"
3659,Disregard.
3660,The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.
3661,"There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Right in the butt. That was great."
3662,"Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in."
3663,"Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything..."
3664,Boo!
3665,"Oh, yeah. So good..."
3666,"Yeah, let's push him down the steps."
3667,How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
3668,Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
3669,That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!
3670,"Bart, you listen."
3671,My secret shame.
3672,"Bart, you're coming home."
3673,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
3674,He locked the door! I'll show him.
3675,You idiot! He was the most talented one!
3676,"Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?"
3677,I do not miss Bart at all.
3678,B'oh!
3679,"Sorry, M.B., but I'm having trouble with this character. Is he supposed to have some kind of neurological impairment like ""Rainman,"" or ""Awakenings""? I mean, what the Hell am I doing here?"
3680,D'oh!
3681,"Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!"
3682,"I'll miss you, son."
3683,"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us."
3684,Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
3685,"Right back atcha, son. Aw."
3686,"And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman."
3687,"Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh."
3688,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?"
3689,"Well, I'm off to work."
3690,"But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement."
3691,"Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere."
3692,"How many ""s""'s in ""innocent""?"
3693,"Yes, deeply concerned."
3694,That is true.
3695,I can't let the boy see me skipping work.
3696,"How do you do, sir?"
3697,Sucker.
3698,Jury duty. I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this.
3699,"I know you can read my thoughts, boy. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow."
3700,Huh?
3701,All right.
3702,"Okay, fine."
3703,What does sequestered mean?
3704,What does deadlocked mean?
3705,"Uh-huh. And ""if""?"
3706,"So ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the Springfield Palace Hotel."
3707,"Where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free HBO - Oooh, ""Free Willy!"""
3708,"Uh, how are the rest of you voting?"
3709,I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddie Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
3710,"Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can."
3711,Room service? Send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.
3712,Shut up.
3713,"Jump, Free Willy, jump! Jump with all your might!"
3714,I don't like this new director's cut.
3715,"Got it, Barn?"
3716,I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.
3717,Souvenir.
3718,"Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was against me in that jury room. But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I prevailed. And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch."
3719,"Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it."
3720,"Maggie, can you point to the monkey?"
3721,Pfft. What do babies know?
3722,What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.
3723,Ooh.
3724,"Or, if not then, Christmas."
3725,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny."
3726,"Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
3727,Oh.
3728,Not at all.
3729,"Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!"
3730,"If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister! And then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!"
3731,"Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool."
3732,"NOW, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO / IF YOU WANT TO GET A KISS / IS ACT REAL SMOOTH / AND MAKE YOUR MOVE LIKE THIS."
3733,NOW WHAT'S THAT RULE?
3734,All right!
3735,"Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him."
3736,Yabba-dabba-doo!
3737,"That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys."
3738,What?!
3739,"Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of ""Nightline""!"
3740,Woo hoo!
3741,Ew yuuuuck!
3742,"Hey, Barney, why don't you fill out the groom's side."
3743,"Whew. Don't try to eat these so-called ""chips."""
3744,Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.
3745,"I mean, woo hoo!"
3746,I was bluffing.
3747,How dare you call me that?!
3748,"So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. As usual, I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm uh... get this... ""A little slow."""
3749,How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?
3750,"You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!"
3751,"Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow..."
3752,Take another bath in malt liquor?
3753,"Oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine making course and I forgot how to drive?"
3754,And how.
3755,"Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him."
3756,"That's it! If he can teach a class, he can teach a class. I mean, I can teach a class."
3757,"Well... I can tell the difference between butter and ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."""
3758,I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?
3759,That depends. Is there another way to get this job?
3760,"I'll do it! Anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging and noise... Of a family of love. Sha la la la."
3761,"Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows."
3762,"Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets."
3763,"Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher."
3764,"Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach."
3765,"Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!"
3766,It's all right! I'm a teacher.
3767,"All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class."
3768,"Down the hall, room twelve."
3769,"Ew. Okay, let's get started."
3770,No talking.
3771,"Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how 'bout you, Otto."
3772,"Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny."
3773,"Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange."
3774,"First you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards."
3775,Okay. But then we've got to get to work.
3776,I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
3777,"No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night we were fighting about money."
3778,I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
3779,Oh yeah. She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
3780,I went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.
3781,"Come on, Marge. Let me in! There's crickets out here."
3782,"Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff."
3783,"Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say."
3784,"Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown."
3785,Yes ma'am.
3786,"Now what is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a wedding as: 'The process of removing weeds from one's garden.'"
3787,"This is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things."
3788,"No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds."
3789,"Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow."
3790,"Well let's just call 'em uh, ""Mr. X"" and ""Mrs. Y."" So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'"
3791,"Not tonight, Marge. Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home."
3792,"Marge, you'll never guess what. My whole class is here. They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives."
3793,"So, little Lisa, apple of my eye. How are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?"
3794,And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?
3795,"Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do."
3796,Why you little...
3797,"Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed..."
3798,"All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary."
3799,Huh?
3800,But I'm not in the cla...
3801,"Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives."
3802,"But, I learned my lesson. It'll never happen again."
3803,"Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing."
3804,"Honey, the door blew shut! Oh. Fine. That's what you want? You got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road. Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I wind up in this crazy old world."
3805,"Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies."
3806,"Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. Oh, these stubborn grass stains."
3807,"Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him."
3808,"Good night, Marge."
3809,Why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture.
3810,"I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together..."
3811,Together?
3812,"Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way."
3813,"Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr."
3814,"OhmyGodohmyGodohmyGod. All right, let's get our stories straight. She tripped, right?"
3815,"Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back."
3816,I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
3817,"Okay, thirty."
3818,"All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever."
3819,"Moe, what are you doing here?"
3820,"Bye, Moe!"
3821,"Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can."
3822,A bouquet of po...
3823,I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.
3824,My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
3825,"Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence."
3826,"Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you."
3827,"Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again."
3828,Wait until my class hears about this. Kidding!
3829,It's great to be indoors with my family.
3830,"Hey, this is dated two weeks ago."
3831,Special present?! I don't wanna wait! I want it now! I want the children to see. Oh. Right. Later.
3832,"Hey, Moe!"
3833,"It's cool in here, boy. For the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator."
3834,I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.
3835,"Marge, can you set the oven to cold?"
3836,"Yes, Lisa?"
3837,I understand. Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.
3838,"Ooh, The Tinkler. I like the sound of that. We'll take it."
3839,"All right, everybody in the pool!"
3840,Is it a pool yet?
3841,Woo hoo!
3842,"Don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer."
3843,"Ah...There's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool."
3844,YAAARR--Ewwwwwww!!
3845,"Lisa! The Blob has got me! Don't touch me, or he'll get you too!"
3846,"Chlorine, eh?"
3847,Mmmm....
3848,"But why? She's such a fox. I mean, what's on Fox tonight? Something ribald, no doubt."
3849,"You see, Marge? You see?"
3850,Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
3851,"Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic."
3852,"Lisa, stop the racket. I'm trying to fix your mother's camera. Now easy... easy."
3853,"Hm, I'm gonna need a bigger drill."
3854,"You're steerin' fine, boy... Hard to the right!"
3855,Hard to the left!
3856,Cat!... Deer!... Old Man!
3857,Jackknifed sugar truck. Sugar?
3858,"Don't worry, buddy. Here's a quarter. Call for help at the nearest phone... I'll keep an eye on things here."
3859,"We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener."
3860,"Read your town charter, boy. ""If food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot."" Since I don't see him around, start shoveling."
3861,"That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound."
3862,"Those are prizes. Ooo, a blasting cap!"
3863,Sugar Man!!
3864,And you didn't think I'd make any money. I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus.
3865,Woo hoo! A four day weekend!
3866,Must... protect... sugar... Thieves everywhere... The strong must protect the sweet... the sweet
3867,"In America, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women."
3868,"Huh, wha?"
3869,"Oh am I, Am I really?"
3870,A-ha!
3871,"All right, pal. Where'd you get the sugar for that tea?"
3872,"Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called ""City Fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson."
3873,No!
3874,Hey! Get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!
3875,"Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!"
3876,"Bees are on the what, now?"
3877,Deal!
3878,Nooooooo! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh what a world!
3879,Oh sugar!
3880,"It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is too much for one man. It's clear now why God portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii."
3881,Like what?
3882,Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
3883,"Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!"
3884,"There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?"
3885,Hmmm.
3886,Hm...
3887,"Mmmm, Chocolate... / Mmmm, invisible cola. / Mmmm, Forbidden donut. / Mmmm sacrilicious. Mmmm, / Mmmm, free goo. Mmmm, something."
3888,"Oh, okay."
3889,"Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off."
3890,"Ooh, that was a close one, kids."
3891,"Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous story of my own."
3892,Hi.
3893,Gotta go.
3894,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
3895,I mean hello!
3896,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator."
3897,That's unsexy.
3898,Ew.
3899,"Well, this is my floor."
3900,See you tomorrow....
3901,"I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in Capital City together..."
3902,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it."
3903,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
3904,Oh!
3905,Go to hell!
3906,I was doing my best to resist her...
3907,"But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom."
3908,"Yeah, yeah."
3909,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.
3910,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
3911,But they're so sweet.
3912,"Oh, baby."
3913,She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
3914,"Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject. But there was one time I got it right..."
3915,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
3916,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!"
3917,Marge?
3918,Sure.
3919,Who? Oh.
3920,"Marge, pour vous."
3921,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go."
3922,But not the last.
3923,"Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybody's a sinner except for this guy."
3924,No no no no no no no no no. Ask your mother.
3925,TV Town! Hammock Land!
3926,Embarrassed? What are you talking about?
3927,Oh yes.
3928,"Hey, look Marge! They're still not fightin' back! I can be a jerk and no one can stop me! Hee hee hee hee!"
3929,Suckers.
3930,Shark-boy!
3931,"Lobster hat... Fishnet Speedo, Jr... Wheelie Shoes... invisible dog leash. Well, I'm packed."
3932,"Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families."
3933,"Ah, the Interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy and Scratchy Land!"
3934,"Don't worry, I've got an ace up my sleeve."
3935,No.
3936,Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?
3937,"The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge."
3938,"Now, to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio."
3939,No.
3940,Don't mind if I do.
3941,"We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all."
3942,"North. ""South."" Nuts to this! I'm going to take a shortcut."
3943,"Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such."
3944,"All right, we're here. Let us never speak of the shortcut again."
3945,"Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot."
3946,One adult and four children.
3947,What's that?
3948,"Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see..."
3949,I'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.
3950,Eyeball stew.
3951,Oh look! It's the twelve noon robot parade! Hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
3952,Parents Island?
3953,It is the '70s! Right down to the smallest detail!
3954,Thank you!
3955,I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the butt.
3956,"But Marge, I was a political prisoner."
3957,I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram?
3958,"Hey look, this one's coming on to me."
3959,"Yoo hoo, Mr. Robot..."
3960,"Lisa, don't contradict your elders."
3961,My hair! You chopped off my hair! Oh God I'm ugly!
3962,Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.
3963,"What're you, the narrator?"
3964,"Die, bad robots, die! With a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero."
3965,But there are five of us.
3966,That's better.
3967,"Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me..."
3968,"When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station."
3969,I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back.
3970,"Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box."
3971,Phew.
3972,Uh-huh.
3973,"Oh, Sideshow Bob."
3974,"It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!"
3975,"Hmm. I don't agree with his Bart-killing policy, but I do approve of his Selma-killing policy."
3976,"I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!"
3977,We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.
3978,Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.
3979,"Hey, Mr. Smithers!"
3980,"Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
3981,"Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again."
3982,John Denver.
3983,"Hm, cable's out... Think I'll have a beer."
3984,"Hm, not a drop in the house. What do you know?"
3985,I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!
3986,"Sorry, sorry. Don't worry, there's plenty I can do to keep myself occupied. Maybe I'll check out that axe collection. See ya later."
3987,Moe! Give me a beer!
3988,Why should I kill my family?
3989,You don't look so happy.
3990,"So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of ""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something something."
3991,"Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!"
3992,Heh-heh. Scaredy-cat...
3993,Can't murder now. Eating.
3994,Noooo!
3995,Heeeeere's Johnny.
3996,Daaaa-vid Lettermaaaan!
3997,"I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer. And I'm Ed Bradley. All this and Andy Rooney tonight on ""60 minutes."""
3998,Must kill family. .
3999,"Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover."
4000,"Urge to kill fading, fading..."
4001,Fading... Rising!
4002,"...Fading, fading, gone."
4003,"Come, family, sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow."
4004,Can't. Frozen.
4005,Urge to kill rising.
4006,"Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy."
4007,Get it off! Get it off! Get it offf!!
4008,"This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools."
4009,There! Better than new! Now to take her for a test toast.
4010,What the-?
4011,Look at that! I'm the first non- Brazilian person to travel backwards through time!
4012,I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. OK. Don't panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...
4013,"Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future."
4014,Stupid bug. You go squish now.
4015,"But that was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right?"
4016,Phew. I'm back.
4017,"Oh, my loving family. Nothing's changed."
4018,"Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV?"
4019,What the hell are you smiling at?
4020,Nooooo!
4021,"Oh no! They're gaining on me. Wait, I have an idea."
4022,These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape.
4023,I gotta go back... Fix future...
4024,This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.
4025,Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it!
4026,"Oh, I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish."
4027,"Hey, where is everybody?"
4028,This is gonna cost me.
4029,"I mean, Heeeyy."
4030,"Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut?"
4031,Don't touch anything?!! I'll... touch... whatever... I... feel like!!
4032,"What's my name?! What color is the sky?! What of donuts? WHAT?! For the love of God, tell meeeee!!!"
4033,Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat.
4034,Eh. Close enough.
4035,"Uh oh, it's seeping in! Stupid cheap weather stripping."
4036,"I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS!"
4037,"No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today."
4038,New glasses?
4039,Probably misses his old glasses.
4040,"Yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
4041,"It was, Marge. Admit it."
4042,"Oh good, here comes the collection plate."
4043,"We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed."
4044,Stop him! He's headed for the window!
4045,"Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all I need."
4046,Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
4047,"Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?"
4048,"Ooo, how convenient."
4049,"See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad."
4050,To the little girl's room!
4051,I like those odds.
4052,"Whew, that's all of 'em. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?"
4053,Done and done.
4054,"Ah, the mysteries of life."
4055,"Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports."
4056,I mean my little girl buddy.
4057,I tried.
4058,"Okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, I'll kill you."
4059,"Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well."
4060,"Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."
4061,"Oh! Ooh my - oh, the hell with it."
4062,"Okay, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, I want to make a few things clear."
4063,"I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel?"
4064,"Come here, you butterball."
4065,"We're laughing with her, Marge! There's a big difference."
4066,With her.
4067,"Okay, little buddy, hop in!"
4068,"Okay, hon."
4069,"Sucker. Competitive, violent, that's why you're here."
4070,"Ah, sorry Bart, Lisa and I are going out for gelato. We'd ask you to come but, you know..."
4071,"Wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. To think of all the time I wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... I love you."
4072,"Quiet down, Bart!"
4073,"Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this."
4074,"And if you get eaten, it's your own fault."
4075,Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
4076,"Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight."
4077,Pass the ketchup.
4078,I asked for ketchup. I'm eating salad here.
4079,"Moe, what are you doin' here?"
4080,"Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best."
4081,"Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?"
4082,"Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!"
4083,Hi kids!
4084,I love Bart!
4085,"No, wait! I love Lisa!"
4086,"Beer. Oh, Marge, I love you!"
4087,"Oh my God, Marge. A penalty shot, with only four seconds left. It's your child versus mine! The winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore."
4088,They're both losers. Losers!
4089,"You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. ."
4090,They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds.
4091,"Sorry kids, but this is one event I want my darling wife by my side."
4092,"Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you."
4093,They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
4094,"Hurry, Marge. If we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving Musketeers."
4095,I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
4096,"Brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... Gimme those, etc."
4097,I don't know.
4098,Mmm hmm. Keep going.
4099,Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.
4100,What dat?
4101,Must have rare gummy. Distract the salesman Marge!
4102,"Now, this is going to take all my skill."
4103,"Run, Marge! Save the booty!"
4104,"See you in hell, candy boys."
4105,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where's my gummy de Milo? Okay, don't panic. She can't have gotten far; she has no arms."
4106,"Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there."
4107,"See, she's having the time of her life."
4108,"So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"
4109,"Nobody's blaming you. Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once."
4110,Precious Venus...
4111,"Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for breakfast."
4112,Oh no! The candy conventioneers tracked us down!
4113,For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...
4114,"Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl."
4115,Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.
4116,"C'mon, I'm a decent guy..."
4117,"Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?"
4118,"That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
4119,"Well, that's kind of a gray area."
4120,"Thanks, kids."
4121,"Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"
4122,"It's okay, they're with me."
4123,"They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay-- go."
4124,Uh-huh?
4125,"You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!"
4126,Y'ello?
4127,"Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it."
4128,"...Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed, she was sitting on the gummy Venus so I grabbed it off of her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is..."
4129,"Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style."
4130,Hee hee. Here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
4131,"Awww, crap!"
4132,"... Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so I grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! Oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! I just wish I had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"
4133,"Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. Now go upstairs and pack your bags. We're gonna start a new life under the sea."
4134,UNDER THE SEA / UNDER THE SEA / THERE'LL BE NO ACCUSATIONS / JUST FRIENDLY CRUSTACEANS / UNDER THE SEA.
4135,Not with that attitude.
4136,"It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothin' ever blows over for me."
4137,"Hey, that's a half truth."
4138,Whaa?
4139,"Ooh, ""Portrait!"" Sounds classy... doesn't it?"
4140,I don't have a friend in the world.
4141,"Oh, Marge. It's a miracle."
4142,I need a hug.
4143,How come you guys hesitated?
4144,Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
4145,Are you hugging the TV?
4146,"I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know - ""Evening at the Improv."" They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."
4147,"Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now."
4148,But those shows all look so crummy.
4149,"Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""Father Goose."" You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. Like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. So I figured, ""We'll see about that."" So I get this big chunk of cinderblock and I..."
4150,"Oh, gotta go. Innocent!"
4151,"Marge, this is so depressing. My only hope is this homemade Prozac. Hmm... needs more ice-cream."
4152,Precious Venus...
4153,Thank you!
4154,You're both right.
4155,Huh?
4156,And Ted Koppel is a robot.
4157,"Oh, that man is sick!"
4158,But listen to the music. He's evil!
4159,"Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing."
4160,Let's never fight again.
4161,"Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late-night TV?"
4162,"No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise."
4163,Enchiladas.
4164,"Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex."
4165,Ooooookay.
4166,Oh. All right.
4167,"Hey, Marge! This guy looks like Apu!"
4168,Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in...
4169,"Oooh. ""Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."""
4170,N -- -- yes. But please don't you say that word.
4171,Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck.
4172,"Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus."
4173,"Oh, here we are. The ""Utility Room."""
4174,"No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room."
4175,Never mind. You wouldn't understand.
4176,No.
4177,No.
4178,No.
4179,You're home safe. Done my duty. See ya the next time we need your signature.
4180,Kids-here's-fifty-dollars-Why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-Aunts'-house-Stay-there-Phone-call-you-later-Now-Now-Now.
4181,"Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards."
4182,You want me to spend more time with dad? What about my New Year's resolution?
4183,Yeah... Where are my pants?
4184,"Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick!"
4185,"Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!"
4186,"Ow. I guess people have some sort of ""moral objection"" to our sex-drug."
4187,Great. I'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
4188,That is correct.
4189,They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
4190,"Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?"
4191,Wow. Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.
4192,Ow!
4193,"Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm."
4194,"Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me."
4195,You're the screw-up!
4196,All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
4197,Get out.
4198,Out.
4199,"Of course not Marge, just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't want to have me!"
4200,"I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child."
4201,"But when I do it, it's cute."
4202,"Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve."
4203,Dad!
4204,"Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!"
4205,"You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president."
4206,I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
4207,Wheeee! Wheeee!!!
4208,B-But I'm using my whole ass.
4209,"Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
4210,Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
4211,Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.
4212,Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain.
4213,I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.
4214,You know what?
4215,We're both screw-ups.
4216,So are you gonna say something nice now?
4217,"Aw, Dad."
4218,"I'm with you, Dad."
4219,This is gonna to be great.
4220,"Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me."
4221,It's Raining Men?
4222,Jokes on them. I'm still alive.
4223,Can't.
4224,I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
4225,"Yes. Cris-a-tunity. You're right! I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've been in my entire life! Bart, where's my wallet?"
4226,Thank you!
4227,"Wow, classy."
4228,Okay.
4229,"Hmmm. This looks like a nice, friendly place."
4230,"Wait a minute. There's something bothering me about this place. I know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. Enjoy your death trap, ladies."
4231,"Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!"
4232,"Here, Puff! Here Puff!"
4233,"The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking."
4234,"Shut up, liver."
4235,"Ooh, my liver hurts."
4236,"I'd like a beer, please."
4237,"Uh, but I am a pilot."
4238,I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
4239,But I -
4240,"Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here."
4241,"But, I keep tellin' ya, I'm not a pilot."
4242,"Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan."
4243,"And um, ah, I'll just uh get us started..."
4244,Woo hoo!
4245,"Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want."
4246,"But Marge, you deserve a vacation. It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state."
4247,"Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?"
4248,"So Marge, pretty sweet, eh?"
4249,"Marge, what's wrong? Are you Hungry? Sleepy? Gassy? Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?"
4250,"Take it easy, Marge. How 'bout if we dope you up real good?"
4251,"It's okay, Marge. We don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us."
4252,I'm sure it's nothing.
4253,Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.
4254,Not everybody.
4255,Where? Where?
4256,"Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. Push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again."
4257,"You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave."
4258,"Marge, it's three A.M. Shouldn't you be baking?"
4259,And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
4260,It's Raining Men!
4261,"Now Marge, ""Dear Abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. Ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""Hero."" ""Fearless."" ""Alive."""
4262,She's fine.
4263,Oh.
4264,"Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?"
4265,"All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist. She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans."
4266,"Well keep it up, then."
4267,"Good, you do that."
4268,You'll be picking many a bean.
4269,"Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down."
4270,All right. How much do you charge?
4271,Keep sliding.
4272,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First, what are your qualifications?"
4273,"Oh, no, I'm not here to take a reading test. I wanna see some credentials."
4274,"You see?! You see?! ""I"" just left ""my"" first session and ""I"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."
4275,Did you talk about me in therapy today?
4276,"Tell me the truth! Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't. Happy family, happy family."
4277,"Oh, being stuck on this God forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite I have."
4278,"Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!"
4279,That's okay. You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. She can get on a plane. That's plenty.
4280,"Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this."
4281,Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax.
4282,That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling.
4283,That's just a carp swimming around your ankles.
4284,What should we do until you get back?
4285,"Aw, it didn't work."
4286,Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.
4287,"Hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?"
4288,"All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list."
4289,"Hey, will you guys help me fix my..."
4290,"Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?"
4291,"Hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?"
4292,Like what?
4293,Shut up.
4294,I saved your life. That egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.
4295,"So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy."
4296,"I do... now. Anyway, I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go."
4297,"Well, something did."
4298,"Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl."
4299,All I have to do is follow the yellow drip road.
4300,"Hee hee hee! I can see everything. And they're none the wiser, hee hee hee."
4301,I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. And I want in.
4302,"Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?"
4303,Next.
4304,"So, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?"
4305,"You'd better run, egg!"
4306,"Why don't people like me, Marge?"
4307,Then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
4308,It is. It's been happening to me all my life.
4309,Why not?
4310,I felt so left out.
4311,I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters.
4312,What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.
4313,"Not as such, no."
4314,"Do I ever! It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge."
4315,Huh?
4316,What?
4317,This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.
4318,I'll take this Communist one too.
4319,"Comin' through! Can't throw me out! My father's a member! I'm in, I'm in!"
4320,"Aw, thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated?"
4321,"Number one? Ha ha. What kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""Hello, my name is Number One."" And so forth."
4322,You outrank Mr. Burns here?
4323,Is he the leader?
4324,"Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story."
4325,I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.
4326,"Hey, have you ever noticed that the ""Crossing the Desert"" is a lot like ""The Unblinking Eye"" and it's exactly like ""The Wreck of the Hesperus""?"
4327,And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
4328,Oh really?
4329,Really?
4330,But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?
4331,"Heh heh heh! So long, suckers!"
4332,"Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door."
4333,Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.
4334,Jealous?
4335,You're jealous.
4336,What's this?
4337,Everything lasts forever.
4338,That's because you trust your stupid school books. Here's what really happened at the signing of the Declaration of Independence...
4339,You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.
4340,"Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which I joined."
4341,WHO RIGS EVERY OSCAR NIGHT? /
4342,"Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren."
4343,The Black Panthers?
4344,"Huh? Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Lenny."
4345,What? Did I miss something?
4346,Please don't kick me out! This society is everything to me! Please give me another chance! I've learned my lesson.
4347,I've learned my lesson!
4348,Oh. Sorry.
4349,Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.
4350,Woo-hoo!
4351,Wow. Mental note. Don't overdo this.
4352,Peek-a-boo!
4353,I always wondered if there was a god. And now I know. There is. And it's me.
4354,So?
4355,No.
4356,Remove the girl.
4357,Woo hoo!
4358,Woo hoo!
4359,I'm out.
4360,"Oh I win again, don't I? Woo hoo."
4361,"You know, I think you guys are lettin' me win."
4362,"From now on, I want you to be honest with me. I mean, I'm not perfect, right?"
4363,"Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading."
4364,"What do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated."
4365,"Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War ."
4366,Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
4367,"Brothers, brothers."
4368,"Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate."
4369,"You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers, the Stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us."
4370,"Hey, fellas. Can I join?"
4371,"Loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg."
4372,"Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club."
4373,"You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to."
4374,This club'd better be worth it.
4375,"Go Knightboat, go!"
4376,Quiet. I will not hear another word against the Boat.
4377,"But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat."
4378,It was Bart.
4379,"So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat."
4380,Thanks honey. Bank shot.
4381,And here's our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two.
4382,Moom.
4383,That's exciting.
4384,"Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story."
4385,"It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa you were the age Bart was several years ago."
4386,Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
4387,"The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""Star Trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
4388,I was at my work station when suddenly...
4389,Not on my shift.
4390,Oh no you don't!
4391,"Simpson ten, terrorists eight."
4392,Okay.
4393,"Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt."
4394,"Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job."
4395,Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.
4396,"Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya."
4397,"Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want."
4398,"Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!"
4399,Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
4400,"Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!"
4401,That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
4402,"And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise."
4403,And now the final phase of my plan.
4404,"Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job here?"
4405,Woo hoo!
4406,Why?
4407,"Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices."
4408,"From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind..."
4409,And only one of you kids can go to college.
4410,That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
4411,Marge...
4412,I've got sand in my underpants.
4413,"I love you, Marge."
4414,Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.
4415,"It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school."
4416,"Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed."
4417,Hi Maggie.
4418,"So anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant."
4419,"Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair."
4420,The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
4421,Mmm... bowling fresh.
4422,Mmm... urinal fresh.
4423,No.
4424,"...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down."
4425,"I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well."
4426,I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
4427,"Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is."
4428,"Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're ""showering"" Marge with gifts."
4429,"Well, it was my major."
4430,"So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done."
4431,Ah... another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.
4432,Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work.
4433,"It's true, the bundle is little. But I'm not in it for the money."
4434,"This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I do enjoy working at the bowling alley."
4435,Man. It's windy as hell out there.
4436,"Hmmm. With little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. Well... I'll be in the tub."
4437,New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!
4438,Oh just that one time.
4439,You're pregnant?!
4440,You're pregnant again?!
4441,"Well who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! Hey, where're you going?"
4442,You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!
4443,Yeah.
4444,Anyhoo...
4445,We're doomed!
4446,Check.
4447,"Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say..."
4448,"Steve -- I mean Al, I think I deserve a raise."
4449,How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?
4450,Of course!
4451,Bowling! Bowling here! Come bowl now! Get yer bowling! Who's ready?! Bowling!
4452,"My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done."
4453,"This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey."
4454,"Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California some day."
4455,I needed more money to support my growing family. And there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.
4456,"Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back."
4457,Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
4458,Thanks for giving me my old job back.
4459,I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.
4460,"Hi honey, how are you?"
4461,I can't go on with this charade any longer. I hate my job. I hate my life. And ever since I found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
4462,"It's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, Marge."
4463,"It's wonderful! It's magical! Oh boy, here it comes - another mouth."
4464,Marvelous.
4465,Okay.
4466,Hello. Aw. It's a boy... And what a boy.
4467,"A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!"
4468,"Come on Marge, show a little enthusiasm."
4469,Absolutely.
4470,"Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up."
4471,...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
4472,"Yeah, except I forgot to go to work."
4473,Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed. Didn't you hear what the guy in the building said?
4474,"Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?"
4475,There's that word again.
4476,"Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
4477,"I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
4478,"So anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
4479,All right!
4480,It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.
4481,Just a second.
4482,"What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
4483,"Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow."
4484,"Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter."
4485,Homer Simpson takes care of his family.
4486,Flanders! Open up!
4487,Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
4488,No deal. Out.
4489,An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?
4490,THERE it is.
4491,I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.
4492,"Uh, yeah. I can do that."
4493,"Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders."
4494,"I'm terribly sorry. Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. So let's kick Flanders out. Sorry."
4495,"No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there."
4496,And it was a baby ox.
4497,"I know kids, I'm scared too."
4498,I am holding still. I am squirming.
4499,It must be the first of the month! New billboard day!
4500,"""This year give her English Muffins."" Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard."
4501,Best in the West. It rhymes.
4502,Clown college? You can't eat that.
4503,"Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever."
4504,Clowns are funny.
4505,Marge.
4506,That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!
4507,Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
4508,You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.
4509,Homer.
4510,"Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life."
4511,Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...
4512,"Steady, steady..."
4513,Kill wealthy dowager.
4514,Got it! No shock for me .
4515,To- Audience -I - now - proclaim - this - new - burger... for sale.
4516,Lord save me.
4517,Omigod! He's stealing all the burgers! Why you little - I've got you!
4518,"Hey, hey."
4519,"And - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and Ah. Here's your giraffe, little girl."
4520,That's the spirit. Never give up.
4521,"I'm beat, and after work I've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the Ace Awards."
4522,"Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something."
4523,"And now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""Starsky and Hutches."""
4524,"Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo."
4525,"Uh... no. I'm going a different way than you, Dick."
4526,"Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it."
4527,"Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business."
4528,Oh no.
4529,I'm not Krusty.
4530,I am not Krusty.
4531,"Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development."
4532,"You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown?"
4533,"I'm telling you, Marge, this will work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been gettin' free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint."
4534,Look at it.
4535,"Well if we agree, then why are we arguing?"
4536,I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty!
4537,"I want everything that's coming to Krusty the clown, which is me... Krusty."
4538,"Hey, what are these holes?"
4539,Oh yeah. Speed holes.
4540,Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.
4541,What keeps doin' that?
4542,But wait. You can't kill me for being Krusty. I'm not him. I'm Homer Simpson.
4543,Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.
4544,"Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi."
4545,Benedict Arnold!
4546,Krusty the clown.
4547,"But, I've never been able to do the..."
4548,How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?
4549,Okay.
4550,I'll never be able to do this trick... never.
4551,Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!
4552,Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!
4553,"Heh-heh, good one, Krusty."
4554,Ta-Da!
4555,I'm a singing in the show... Hot! Yeow! Cold! Ow! Hot! Cold! Hot! Ow! Who's! Doing! That?!
4556,Burkina Faso? Disputed Zone? Who called all these weird places?
4557,"No, I'm gonna ask Marge."
4558,"Psh, that's no reason to block the TV."
4559,"There it is. ""Aust-rali-a."" I'll be damned..."
4560,"Look at this country: ""U - r - gay."""
4561,"Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. What can we do for you?"
4562,"That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man."
4563,"All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?"
4564,We left at 1:30 P.M. Monday. What time is it now?
4565,"Hey, are you like one of those English guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?"
4566,"Oh, yeah, this is the life. Boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in Orlando, Florida?"
4567,SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY... OF THEE I SING.
4568,"Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!"
4569,Australia! America! Austr--
4570,"--alia! America, Australia, Ameri-- ow!"
4571,"Hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about."
4572,"No. It's pretty big, I guess."
4573,Punishment?!
4574,Booting?
4575,What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
4576,"You sold us out, Conover!"
4577,Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!
4578,"When will you Australians learn? In America, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. The streets are safe. Old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. And the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. So, like us, let your children run wild and free. Because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. Now boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil!"
4579,"Yeah, there's a lot more mucus!"
4580,Maaarge!
4581,"Show 'em what American butts are made of, son!"
4582,"Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?"
4583,"Hey, look. Those frogs are eating all their crops."
4584,Take a guess.
4585,"Yeah, that's right Barney. This year I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October, and I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang, that's when I'll cash in."
4586,"All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one."
4587,How am I going to tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle.
4588,My house is on fire! Woo hoo! Insurance to the rescue.
4589,"Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after six, and I stop eating your lipstick."
4590,"All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
4591,Wrong!
4592,"Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow."
4593,"Hello Vegas? Give me 100 bucks on red. All right, I'll send you a check."
4594,If only I could think of an invention. Something that would really make money. Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked...
4595,"Uh, could I just get a look at that?"
4596,"But uh, could I just..."
4597,Let me see! Let me see! Out of the way!
4598,"No, my invention! All my money problems could've..."
4599,"Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not."
4600,"And Lisa, my little princess."
4601,And who could forget dear Rat boy?
4602,"Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn't you just bash my head in?"
4603,Rye am Romer Rimpson...
4604,"Uh, I need an another extension on my mortgage payments."
4605,That was in the third grade.
4606,"Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight."
4607,Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
4608,"All right, you'll get your money."
4609,"You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money."
4610,What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family. Someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.
4611,"Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair."
4612,"Mmmm, slanty."
4613,Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
4614,It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
4615,"All right, you had your fun. Now get lost."
4616,Hunh?
4617,No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.
4618,"Well, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again."
4619,Request permission to slink by.
4620,But you're already smoking cig...
4621,You're really pushing it.
4622,I'll have to trust you on that.
4623,No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!
4624,"But... Yes, ma'am."
4625,"Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge."
4626,What paper?
4627,"I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings."
4628,You told!
4629,Sorry Marge.
4630,I never want to see you again! You either!
4631,"I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight."
4632,Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
4633,"In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar."
4634,What was that -- national anthem?
4635,Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the Want Ads to find a part-time job.
4636,"Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine."
4637,I'll never pay off that debt.
4638,"That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa."
4639,"No. Well anyway, turn it off."
4640,"Oh wow! I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, Mel Brooks! I love that movie, ""Young Frankenstein"". ...Scared the Hell out of me."
4641,"Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face."
4642,"Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?"
4643,"Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt!"
4644,"Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert."
4645,"Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm."
4646,"Look, all I ask is that you be fair."
4647,"You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?"
4648,"Nagging the driver, minus ten points for you."
4649,"Being a jerk, minus a million points."
4650,"Well, I..."
4651,I'll never forgive myself for this.
4652,Yes. I am in flavor country.
4653,It's a big country.
4654,"Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides."
4655,"I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you."
4656,Call off the debt?
4657,Call off the debt?
4658,"Debt's off! Let's go, Marge. Woo hoo!"
4659,"Marge, are we Jewish?"
4660,Woo hoo!
4661,Mmmmm.
4662,But what can I do? I'm just... one man.
4663,"Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny! Stupid Dockers! Oh, the belt is buckled."
4664,My ears are burning.
4665,"No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip."
4666,"Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?"
4667,"Oh, you're right."
4668,There ya... Just second...
4669,"Oh, that should..."
4670,It was a gummy bear.
4671,"Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the Critic."
4672,"But, I'm still hungry."
4673,"Yeah, well I won the belching contest at work."
4674,"Yeah, well Scooby Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter!"
4675,"Whatcha doing, Marge?"
4676,"Marge, do you respect my intelligence?"
4677,Okay! Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes?
4678,Okay! Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?
4679,"Okay! Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy. But does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song?"
4680,"That's it, Marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by."
4681,"It's just you and me now, lock of hair..."
4682,"Yeah, well you think I'm stupid."
4683,Prove it.
4684,Put me on that film jury festival thing.
4685,"Exactly. Heh, heh."
4686,Pull my finger.
4687,This contest is over. Give that man the ten thousand dollars!
4688,But ... The ball... His groin!... It works on so many levels! Roll it again.
4689,What'd I miss?
4690,Football in the groin. Football in the groin.
4691,"Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute."
4692,I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
4693,"Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me."
4694,"Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do."
4695,Hm. Barney's movie has heart. But football in the groin had a football in the groin.
4696,Wow. I'll never drink another beer.
4697,I'll take ten.
4698,"Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket."
4699,"Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts."
4700,Can I have some?
4701,"Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon."
4702,I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.
4703,"Woo hoo! Oh, Marge, that's great news!"
4704,"Oh, ah, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married!"
4705,"Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news."
4706,Maggie! I need to use the phone!
4707,"Will that girl ever shut up? Okay, Marge. I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's. Wait, why not have the whole wedding there? We'll do it on a Monday morning -- there'll be fewer drunks."
4708,"Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be out back in the hammock."
4709,"Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?"
4710,"Whew! Uh, enjoy."
4711,"You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box."
4712,"Oh, right."
4713,"So, Hugh. Have you heard all the latest American jokes? Uh, here's a good one. Pull my finger."
4714,"I said, pull my finger."
4715,Me and Bart'll take Hugh out on the town this afternoon.
4716,Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.
4717,"So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh Hugh?"
4718,"Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive."
4719,"Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again."
4720,Keep it down in there!
4721,"Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya."
4722,"You know what's great about you English? ""Octopussy."" Man, I must have seen that movie... twice."
4723,Ooh la la.
4724,"You look great, sweetheart."
4725,"Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. You know, I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me."
4726,"No, no, let me finish. I just want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. You helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter, and I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--"
4727,See? You're still helping me.
4728,"Aw, no..."
4729,I found them on the night stand this morning. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.
4730,"Lisa, Lisa! Where were you!? You missed the most incredible thing!"
4731,I ate seven pounds of fudge!
4732,The man at the stand said it was a record!
4733,I rode the teacups! Then I got a little sick and I had to sit down. But then I rode 'em again!
4734,Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?
4735,Did they?!
4736,"Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'."
4737,"My ""Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak"" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff!"
4738,Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable!
4739,"Well, problem solved."
4740,You got it.
4741,"Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'."
4742,"Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know."
4743,Two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? Gimme the ticket.
4744,We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on.
4745,"You're lucky you got looks, Marge."
4746,"Yes! Come on, you little horse!"
4747,"Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex."
4748,Now it's two sets of twins.
4749,"Yes, we've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family."
4750,Get that cat out of the way!
4751,Ooh... this time... Ah...
4752,Do you have a better idea?
4753,"How do you explain the culottes, boy?"
4754,Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away.
4755,Mainly your mother.
4756,Splendid. Who's coming?
4757,Who wouldn't?
4758,"Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired?"
4759,"A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies."
4760,"Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds."
4761,Lousy teachers. Trying to palm off our kids on us.
4762,"Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way."
4763,"Well, it's always in the last place you look."
4764,I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.
4765,"I'm with you, Marge. Lisa, get in here! In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics."
4766,"So, how was everybody's day at school?"
4767,"Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there."
4768,"Well, I've had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady."
4769,"Oh, this is wonderful! You're alive!"
4770,Why you little...
4771,Really? Wow.
4772,"Kids are so naïve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""Do Not Feed The Bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
4773,"Now get to school, boy."
4774,"Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog."
4775,Woo hoo!
4776,"Oh, right."
4777,Woo hoo!
4778,"Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?"
4779,"Oh I'm sure he knew. And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy."
4780,"Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over."
4781,"Remember, honey?"
4782,"What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman."
4783,I blew it again.
4784,Mmmmmm.
4785,"Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love."
4786,Starland Vocal Band?! They suck!
4787,And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.
4788,Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
4789,"OK, then this. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo"
4790,They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?
4791,"Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave."
4792,We're outta here!
4793,"Whoa, careful now. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types... So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone."
4794,Woo hoo! Easy money!
4795,Then how come that guy's winning?
4796,"Twenty on this one, my good man."
4797,No Marge!!
4798,"Marge, are you okay?"
4799,"Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman."
4800,"Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here."
4801,You did what?!!
4802,Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
4803,"Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing."
4804,"Aw, thanks, honey."
4805,"Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me."
4806,"Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border."
4807,Mmm. Incapacitating.
4808,"Shush, dear, you'll wreck Daddy's fun."
4809,". Fooled you Flanders. Made you think your family was dead. Didja get it? They're not, though."
4810,But you thought they were.
4811,That's why it was so funny. But they're not.
4812,"""The Girls of the Internet."" Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day."
4813,"Are you kidding? Being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries; we get a free funeral for Marge, God forbid; and I can run background checks on whomever I want Mohammar--"
4814,"Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour."
4815,"All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --"
4816,"Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies."
4817,"Oh, you've become such a cop! And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs."
4818,You're cooking what for dinner?
4819,"Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?"
4820,"That's okay. I'm supposed to be workin', too."
4821,"I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there."
4822,I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
4823,"C'mon, we're family."
4824,"I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!"
4825,"What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc."
4826,"Whuh! Marge, not here. Hey, you're not really arresting me...?"
4827,I choose to waive that right.
4828,Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
4829,"I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la ""I Love Lucy"" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side."
4830,"Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""Spaceballs."" But instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""Police Academy."""
4831,"All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage."
4832,Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
4833,"Well, what do you call it?"
4834,"Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here."
4835,Okay.
4836,"Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
4837,"Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this."
4838,"It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen."
4839,Marge!
4840,"Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you."
4841,"He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!"
4842,"Marge, how did you know..."
4843,"No, what I was wondering is..."
4844,"Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
4845,What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
4846,"Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!"
4847,"Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech..."
4848,"Yes, there is. Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! I got an R.V. we can use... Flanders's!"
4849,"Pile in, everybody! No time to wipe your feet!"
4850,Found 'em!
4851,"You kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this."
4852,"I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!"
4853,That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
4854,Stupider like a fox!
4855,I'm okay.
4856,"This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower."
4857,"Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down."
4858,No one in history has ever done anything this clever.
4859,"That's okay, son. I'll take care of him."
4860,"Faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!"
4861,Sorry.
4862,Woo-hoo!
4863,"Here's your package, Mr. Burns!"
4864,--son!
4865,"I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
4866,What? What's your idea?
4867,"That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?"
4868,"Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card."
4869,"Kids, would you step outside for a second?"
4870,F-F-F-F-F-F-
4871,"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it!"
4872,What?
4873,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!
4874,"Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!"
4875,He can't remember my name!
4876,"Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?"
4877,"Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers."
4878,My tool shed! Oh Dad!
4879,Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
4880,"Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name..."
4881,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson!
4882,"Me! Me! Me, me!"
4883,"I swear, I've never seen that gun before."
4884,"Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit."
4885,No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the floor?
4886,"So you finally learned my name, eh?"
4887,I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.
4888,Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.
4889,Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.
4890,"Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?"
4891,Which one were you? The ugly one?
4892,Were you the ugly one?
4893,"Guess what, kids. They're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here."
4894,Careful now.
4895,"Hey, didn't you direct ""Unnatural Discretion""?"
4896,"Hooey! Whew, oh. You know, I never walk out of a movie, but Eech!"
4897,You guys work on the movie?
4898,"Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to you?"
4899,"Marge, there's a spider near my car keys."
4900,"Ahhh, that's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear."
4901,"Oh, never you mind..."
4902,"What advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? Which I could also afford."
4903,No we shan't. Yoink!
4904,"Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon."
4905,I got my dad to look after her.
4906,"C'mon, Honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you."
4907,"Yeah. If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel."
4908,I love gettin' away from this dump.
4909,We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
4910,Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.
4911,"Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant."
4912,Lousy houseplant!
4913,I can see Lisa... but it might be a starfish. I've gotta call 'em!
4914,"Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!"
4915,"Who? Lady, you got the wrong file."
4916,"Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie."
4917,Communication. Gotcha.
4918,"Listen. Yes, I know."
4919,I have listening skills!
4920,"Shut up, Judge!"
4921,Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.
4922,What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
4923,I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
4924,That's it.
4925,"Todd Smells. Aw, I already knew that."
4926,Why you cotton pickin' --
4927,"No! I've gotta pass this class for my kids. Son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
4928,"I love you, Cletus!"
4929,"Kids, we're good parents now! Get your asses out here!"
4930,Oh no! In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseseses!
4931,"Okay, okay, don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders!"
4932,The Springfield River!
4933,Son of a bitch...
4934,Noooooooo!
4935,"Oh, Bartholemew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan."
4936,"I said shut your ugly face, Flanders."
4937,"Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie."
4938,Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!
4939,Old painty-can Ned!
4940,"Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?"
4941,I'm not ashamed.
4942,How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?
4943,I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!
4944,Forty seconds? But I want it now.
4945,"Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?"
4946,"Hi, is Milhouse home?"
4947,Mmm. Sounds good.
4948,"Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!"
4949,And he knows my name.
4950,"Bart, you didn't finish your Spaghetti and Moe-Balls!"
4951,"Run, boy! Run!"
4952,Run for your life!... ... Boy!
4953,Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?
4954,"Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?"
4955,"What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?"
4956,Let me get a pad....
4957,No.
4958,No.
4959,No.
4960,That's the plan.
4961,"Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down."
4962,"It was good, but not great."
4963,"Come on, eat the can. Come on."
4964,"Out of the way, you."
4965,Aww.
4966,Hey Flanders!
4967,Shut up.
4968,"So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?"
4969,I can't believe you didn't invite me after I painted those cool stripes all over your car. I know! I'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show ya.
4970,Sure.
4971,"This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge."
4972,"You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever."
4973,"Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb."
4974,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?"
4975,Ham?
4976,Pork chops?
4977,"Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal."
4978,"Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's."
4979,That's a typo.
4980,"But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, ""Yo, Goober! Where's the meat?"" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad."
4981,"Wow, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg."
4982,"I've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection."
4983,One whopper for the copper.
4984,Here ya go!
4985,"Okay, everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for! The pig de résistance!"
4986,Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
4987,It's just a little dirty -- It's still good! It's still good!
4988,It's just a little slimy! It's still good! It's still good!
4989,It's just a little airborne! It's still good! It's still good!
4990,I know.
4991,"Lisa, you ruined my barbecue. I demand you apologize this second!"
4992,That's it! Go to your room!
4993,"Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?"
4994,"Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning."
4995,"Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out."
4996,"Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case."
4997,"Bart, go to your room!"
4998,"I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all."
4999,That's it. Go to your room.
5000,Lisa! Lisa!
5001,"Lisa! Lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am!"
5002,I dunno. Were you looking for me?
5003,"Oh, Lisa, I was looking for you. I wanted to apologize. I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault."
5004,Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?
5005,"I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid."
5006,"C'mon, I'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, I mean a veggie-back ride home."
5007,"Ah, the Miracle Mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. It truly is a miracle."
5008,"There it is! The chain that put the ""fat"" in ""fat Southern sheriffs!"""
5009,I want a colossal donut. Just like the one on the sign.
5010,Nuts!
5011,That's false advertising! Lard Lad lied!
5012,"I paid for a colossal donut, and I'm gonna get a colossal donut."
5013,Eggheads. What do they know?
5014,"Hee hee hee. I've got your donut, Lard Lad! And what are you gonna do about it?"
5015,Get what?
5016,"Well... I acquired it legally, you can be sure of that."
5017,Hello? Yes? Oh! Uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... Flanders has it. Just smash open his house.
5018,He came to life. Good for him.
5019,I told you: Flanders has it. Or Moe! Go kill Moe.
5020,Well... okay. If it'll end horror.
5021,Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?
5022,Mmmm.... sprinkles.
5023,We'll be right back.
5024,Bart?! Is that you?
5025,Take out the garbage.
5026,Lousy Smarch weather.
5027,Do not touch Willie. Good advice.
5028,"Oh, no. Better ride this one out in the closet."
5029,"Oh yeah? Well it's my house, so it's my spot."
5030,Did not.
5031,You are?
5032,They got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
5033,Huh? I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
5034,That's weird. It's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
5035,I'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
5036,Holy macaroni!
5037,Hello? Can anybody hear me?
5038,I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
5039,"Just a second... No, it's a place I've never been before."
5040,Hey!
5041,"I don't want to alarm you, Marge..."
5042,But I seem to be trapped in here.
5043,What's going on here? I'm so bulgy...
5044,My stomach sticks way out in front and my...
5045,"Hey, shut up!"
5046,Mmm... Unprocessed fish sticks.
5047,"Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it."
5048,"Ow! Watch it, coney."
5049,Oops.
5050,Yes.
5051,Ow!
5052,"Um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie ""Tron""?"
5053,"Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
5054,"Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy."
5055,Help! I don't have much time!
5056,I'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... I'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! I don't know...
5057,"Piece of cake, son!"
5058,Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap!
5059,Craaaaaaaaaap!
5060,Eww. This is the worst place yet.
5061,Omigod...
5062,"Ooh, erotic cakes!"
5063,Someone's in here.
5064,Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo!
5065,"Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait."
5066,TWO!
5067,Arrgh!
5068,"Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?"
5069,"Stupidity, eh?"
5070,Must hurt self. Must hurt self. Must hurt self.
5071,"Hmm, probably better that didn't hit me."
5072,Hello.
5073,"Um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?"
5074,Thank you.
5075,"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? No. Lumber Lung? No. Juggler's Despair? No. Achy-Breaky Pelvis? No. Oh, I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy!"
5076,"Hey, wait... ""Hyper-Obesity."" ""If you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""
5077,Yes I can.
5078,"Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!"
5079,"I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body."
5080,"No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us."
5081,"Yes, sweetheart?"
5082,"Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy."
5083,Can you recommend a doctor who will?
5084,Of course.
5085,"What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?"
5086,"Oh, it's a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything I've always wanted. Now c'mon! Every second I'm out of bed, I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'!"
5087,I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?
5088,"Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight!"
5089,Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home...
5090,Any time I want.
5091,"Hey, Flanders, bad day at the rat races?"
5092,"Hello, honey."
5093,"I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability."
5094,"So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow."
5095,Beautiful. G'night.
5096,I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.
5097,I need a miracle.
5098,"Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut..."
5099,"Well, that's a plus."
5100,Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it!
5101,Oh my.
5102,"Oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting."
5103,Thank you for your pity.
5104,I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work.
5105,"Well, I use a computer!"
5106,I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu.
5107,I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.
5108,Eight fifty-eight. First time I've ever been early for work. Except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers.
5109,"""To start, press any key."" Where's the ""any"" key?"
5110,"I see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. There doesn't seem to be any ""any"" key. All this computer hacking is making me thirsty. I think I'll order a Tab."
5111,Check core temperature? Yes-slash-No. Yes.
5112,"Core temperature normal. Not too shabby. ""Vent radioactive gas?"" N-O."
5113,Venting prevents explo-si-on. This is hard. Where's my Tab? Okay then -- yes. Vent the stupid gas.
5114,Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.
5115,"Well, why don't you live in it then?"
5116,"Yes, honey?"
5117,You dragged me all the way from work for that?
5118,I...
5119,Pro: I'm drought and famine resistant.
5120,"Pro: I, uh... don't have to go to work."
5121,Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you?
5122,"Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here."
5123,"And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake?"
5124,Vent radioactive gas?... Y-E-S.
5125,Sound alertness horn? Y-E-S.
5126,"""Decalcify calcium ducts?"" Well, gimme a Y. Gimme a--"
5127,"Hey, all I have to type is ""Y."""
5128,"Hey, Miss Doesn't-Find-Me-Attractive Sexually-Anymore. I just tripled my productivity."
5129,"Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y."
5130,"Y, Y... What the heck are you doing over there?"
5131,There. There. You found the floor.
5132,YYY... Y... Y... Y...
5133,Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--
5134,The mail! The mail is here!
5135,"Oooo! ""An Urgent Plea From Edward James Olmos!"" ""Lisa Simpson: Can you afford to miss another issue of The Utne Reader?"" Kids."
5136,Free sample of fabric softener? Woo hoo!
5137,"Hmmm, I can feel three kinds of softness."
5138,"Washing my fat guy hat, honey."
5139,"Hey, what are you kids looking at?"
5140,Don't make me close the shade!
5141,Nuts to that. I'm going to the movies.
5142,I got someone to cover for me.
5143,"One for ""Honk,"" please."
5144,What are you talking about?
5145,I could sit in the aisle.
5146,"Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity! I just came here to see ""Honk If You're Horny"" in peace."
5147,"Oh, that's raspberry."
5148,"This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! I'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! The overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. And they're gonna make their voices heard! All they need is a leader!"
5149,"I'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! What happened to my bird?"
5150,Marge?... Lisa?... Flanders?...
5151,Explosion imminent?!
5152,"Omigod, the plant's gonna explode!"
5153,"Wait, I know! ""Vent Gas."""
5154,Pressure too high?
5155,Tank must be shut down manually?! Stupid bird! I never should have put you in charge! Why you...
5156,"Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault."
5157,Shut up!
5158,I gotta call the plant and warn them!
5159,"I'm gonna have to shut it down myself. Fat, don't fail me now."
5160,The ice cream man!
5161,"Get away, dammit! Run for your lives!"
5162,Let go! I gotta get to the tank!
5163,Stupid switch! I wish I had my reaching-broom!
5164,Wait a minute! There's probably a --
5165,"Thank you, Mr. Burns. It was pretty scary up there. But... For a while I feared for my life."
5166,Mr. Burns... Can you make me thin again?
5167,Woo hoo!
5168,Hey everybody! Up here!
5169,"Right away, Mr. Smithers! I'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --"
5170,"Best six hundred bucks I ever spent. C'mon, boy. We've earned this Saturday, now let's make the most of it."
5171,Sixty-one... Sixty-two... Sixty-three...
5172,That's m'name.
5173,"Listen here. My name is Homer J. Simpson. You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not. Now I want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."
5174,"I don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. What do you have in that secret government file, anyway? I have a right to read it."
5175,"""Wife: Marjorie. Children: Bartholomew, Lisa..."" Aha! See, this thing is all screwed up. Who the heck is ""Margaret"" Simpson?"
5176,"""Youngest daughter..."" Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid."
5177,You see that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave. My Dad points it out every time we drive by.
5178,"Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you. I'm just not a cemetery person."
5179,Here lies... Walt Whitman?!!
5180,"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson."""
5181,Why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!
5182,"I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?"
5183,I thought you were dead.
5184,Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.
5185,"Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?"
5186,"Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment."
5187,I'm sorry.
5188,"Hey, everybody, I've got a big surprise for you! Presenting: my mother!"
5189,I'll Kwaanza you!
5190,This is my room. This is my dresser. It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.
5191,You remembered.
5192,"Oh, I've missed moments like this... Mom."
5193,"Hey, Mom, lookit me! Look at what I can do!"
5194,Mo-om! You're not looking!
5195,Woo hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back! I never realized how much I missed her.
5196,But?
5197,"First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason."
5198,I 'unno. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
5199,Then why did she leave me?
5200,I thought I dreamed that kiss.
5201,"Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?"
5202,"Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
5203,Any undelivered mail for Homer J. Simpson?
5204,Hey!
5205,Seven!
5206,"Rhetorical, eh? Eight."
5207,"Do I know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
5208,You could live with Grampa again.
5209,"Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?"
5210,"It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. But who are you, and why did you tip us off?"
5211,Thanks.
5212,Yak yak yak yak yak.
5213,At least this time I'm awake for your goodbye.
5214,Don't forget me.
5215,That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big. Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob?
5216,"Oh, yeah... But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now?"
5217,Free Duff! Viva life!
5218,"They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes."
5219,"Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?"
5220,"Oo, look, it's Maggie!"
5221,Uh... Maggie?
5222,"Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!"
5223,"Okay, so we can't go over the fence."
5224,"I'm sure they're fine, honey."
5225,"Hang on, boy! Daddy's comin' to save ya!"
5226,"Well, I wrecked the gate but you don't hear me bragging. Now let's roll."
5227,"Jump, boy! I gotcha!"
5228,"Now you, boy!"
5229,"Well, goodnight, son."
5230,Yeah.
5231,Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.
5232,"Good night, son."
5233,We may be the best parents in the world.
5234,Goodnight.
5235,There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.
5236,Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies?
5237,Somebody ate those cookies.
5238,I think she's trying to tell us something.
5239,"Go on, Maggie. Go. Go."
5240,Wake up everybody! It's World War Three!
5241,"Quick, down to the fallout shelter! The bombs are dropping!"
5242,"Eighteen seconds, hmph. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what?"
5243,"Bart! Bart! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy!"
5244,"Bart! Where are ya, boy."
5245,Aha!
5246,"There you go. Now that's not so bad, is it?"
5247,Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.
5248,I don't know.
5249,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
5250,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
5251,Yabba dabba doo!
5252,"SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE"
5253,"Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard."
5254,I'll take care of this.
5255,Ants!
5256,"...""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something, something."
5257,Don't mind if I do.
5258,"Ooh, sorry. Here's another one."
5259,"But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?"
5260,"No, I work at the nuclear power plant."
5261,"Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside."
5262,Woo hoo! Ow!
5263,"No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'."
5264,"Bart, you're coming home."
5265,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
5266,"Young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""..."
5267,"I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight."
5268,"Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!"
5269,Hmmm. We didn't have a message when we left. How very odd.
5270,"Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?"
5271,"'Tis the season, Marge! We only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!"
5272,"Oh, no, I'm not."
5273,Hey! I don't remember saying that!
5274,I wanna price some flip-flops and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!
5275,Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.
5276,"Hmm. Wonder where the flip-flops are.... ""Menswear?"""
5277,"Maybe it's ""Sporting Goods""... Wait, no, ""Sleepwear""... Oh, probably ""Better Living."""
5278,"Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas..."
5279,Pfft. Must have been a pretty slow century.
5280,What are you doing to my son?!!
5281,"Stealing?! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain what's-his-name? We live in a society of laws. Why do you think I took you to all those ""Police Academy"" movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Where was I? Oh yeah, stay out of my booze!"
5282,"I've figured out the boy's punishment. First: he's grounded. No leaving the house, not even for school. Second: No eggnog. In fact, no nog period. And third, absolutely no stealing for three months."
5283,"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
5284,"Check it out, boy! It's like looking into a living snow mirror!"
5285,"Get 'im, Ma!"
5286,"Ooo! ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions""! I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy."
5287,"I don't think so, stupid!"
5288,"No, I want roast beef, you clod!"
5289,The All igh-ty ollar? I get it.
5290,Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.
5291,"Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think."
5292,I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.
5293,"Hey, we can be a team!"
5294,Woo hoo! We won! We won!
5295,"Excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl."
5296,Uh...
5297,That longhair freak's bowled with us for years.
5298,"Five hundred dollars?! No problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?"
5299,"Aw, come on, Marge! You're getting something in return! And I'm getting a bowling team. It's win/win!"
5300,"Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
5301,"Ooh, I've got to get the third degree from you, too?"
5302,"Uh... Excuse me, Mr. Burns?"
5303,"Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars."
5304,"Hey, everybody, if you want to ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or something!"
5305,"Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us."
5306,"C'mon, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / HELP EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'LL BE OUR MOTTO..."
5307,"DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO..."
5308,"Lemme set the scene for you, Marge."
5309,It's a 7-10 split.
5310,The hardest shot in bowling. It was all up to me.
5311,"So I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match."
5312,"I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess."
5313,"Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort and I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me."
5314,But... but...
5315,"There it is, boys, the championship trophy!"
5316,"Ah, ha, ha, ha, God-boy couldn't get a strike."
5317,"Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!"
5318,Gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.
5319,Then what are you dressed like that for?
5320,"""They made us!"" That's loser talk! You gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! Nothing's gonna stop us now!"
5321,"By the way, rhyming Homer with Homer..."
5322,You want to join my what?
5323,"Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no."
5324,Welcome aboard. It wasn't any easier.
5325,"Uh, Mr. Burns, next week is the big championship game..."
5326,"Aw, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship. Now thanks to Burns it's never gonna happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case."
5327,So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!
5328,Marge! Someone broke the toilet!
5329,"Mr. Burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that..."
5330,Awww.
5331,You're off the team.
5332,Thanks.
5333,"Goodbye, trophy."
5334,"I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change, and then quickly change back."
5335,Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.
5336,"Marge, I'm bored."
5337,Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.
5338,Eh. I'll do it anyway.
5339,"Come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors."
5340,Good ol' Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.
5341,It's easier. Duh.
5342,"Uh, spray the boy."
5343,"Well, ready for the big rummage sale?"
5344,"Hey, I never noticed this place!"
5345,"Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?"
5346,The guy who doesn't live there.
5347,"But, Marge, it works on any Ayatollah! Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi... Even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!"
5348,"Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun. I need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing."
5349,"Oh. I wanted to write ""DISCO STUD"" but I ran out of space. Not that ""Disco Stu"" didn't get his share of the action!"
5350,"Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that."
5351,Hey everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?
5352,"So, anyone here from... Evergreen Terrace?"
5353,I think this is the best neighborhood in town. Anybody agree with me?
5354,Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?
5355,"Well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
5356,And for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
5357,"Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!..."
5358,"Hey, big spender!..."
5359,Spend some dough at Table Three!
5360,"Thank you, neighbors, thank you! Now let's give it up for Table Five! Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Five, Table Five... Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve..."
5361,"Table Five, Table Five..."
5362,"Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!"
5363,"Okay, let's give it up for the new guy. Now let's all turn around and pay attention to me again. Hello? Hello?"
5364,Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
5365,Stupid president. Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
5366,"Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him--"
5367,"I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical."
5368,"Oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to Bush."
5369,I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. Heh heh heh.
5370,"Oh, man, I've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those Breakfast Balls..."
5371,"Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!"
5372,Hey! My taxes paid for that horn!
5373,"All right. His story checks out. Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it will make you happy."
5374,"Well, you can always depend on that."
5375,"He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?"
5376,"First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!"
5377,"Hey, Bush! Get out here!"
5378,I'm going to punch George Bush in the face!
5379,You owe me an apology!
5380,"Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh! Well, you are a wimp."
5381,"Oh, I want trouble all right."
5382,"No, you're gonna get trouble."
5383,Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
5384,Trouble it is.
5385,This is gonna be sweet. Two hundred bottle rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.
5386,Yoo hoo?
5387,"It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!"
5388,"Okay, son! Give him the glue!"
5389,He's not lost.
5390,It's time to hit him where he lives.
5391,Bingo.
5392,"So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?"
5393,"It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!"
5394,"For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!"
5395,You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!
5396,"Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
5397,"Woo hoo! In your face, Bush! Now apologize for the tax hike."
5398,Former President Gerald Ford? Put 'er there! I'm Homer Simpson.
5399,Do I ever!
5400,"Yes, Mr. Ford!"
5401,"Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just fi--"
5402,"Oh, he wants that corn so much!"
5403,Sit down! / You're breaking -- / Don't touch that--
5404,Yay!! We're getting a new TV!!
5405,"Look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!"
5406,"I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny."
5407,"Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringin' in the pennies."
5408,You look great.
5409,Spurlock's Cafeteria it is.
5410,What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
5411,But Sipowicz does it.
5412,I wish I was Sipowicz.
5413,Simpson family.
5414,"Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in."
5415,"You should've held out longer, boy."
5416,"Boy, Marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers."
5417,That's one way.
5418,Not an issue.
5419,Huh?
5420,Really?
5421,"Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?"
5422,"Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, Marge?"
5423,Seat down.
5424,"Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for."
5425,"Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
5426,Yes.
5427,Woo hoooooooooo--
5428,"Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge..."
5429,He got to the green in one shot?!
5430,How - can - that - old - man - hit - SO - FAR?!!
5431,And what are you doing with his ball?
5432,And all those other balls?!
5433,"These aren't reptile eggs! You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!"
5434,So you're not the best golfer here! Wait'll I tell everyone about this! You stink!
5435,Bull-honkey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.
5436,I'm driving up to the main building. They've got valet parking tonight.
5437,"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
5438,"I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?"
5439,"I just won't say anything, okay, honey?"
5440,"You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are."
5441,Our savings?!
5442,"They have beer and gum, right?"
5443,Poor Aunt Hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...
5444,"Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts."
5445,"Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts."
5446,Best night's sleep I ever had.
5447,"Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers, one IRS-Wich -- withhold the lettuce -- three dependent-sized sodas and a FICAccino."
5448,Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
5449,"Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans."
5450,Wow.
5451,"Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in Heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin... I wish I were dead."
5452,"Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy. People die all the time. Just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night."
5453,"Hey, they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. Look, I can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier... an apprentice! I think I'll be an apprentice, Marge."
5454,That's for my master to decide.
5455,You think so?
5456,"Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot."
5457,"You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!"
5458,Hear ye! Hear ye! Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! Chooseth Homer Simpson and he shalt rock thy world!
5459,"Less chat, more hat."
5460,"Woo hoo! Hear ye! Hear ye! The Homer Broadcasting System is on the air! All hollering, all the time! I'm gonna make the..."
5461,Okay.
5462,"Hear ye, hear ye! What's for breakfast?"
5463,"I don't understand thee, Marge."
5464,"No tongue, eh? How did he talk and eat and laugh and love?"
5465,"Yes, that'd do."
5466,The dastard!
5467,"I believe you, honey."
5468,"Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing, and for once, I want in on the ground floor."
5469,"Well, nice talking to you."
5470,Lisa?
5471,"I've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. So here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat."
5472,But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife.
5473,"Come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case."
5474,"Town Crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife."
5475,"Oh yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it!"
5476,"Oh, sure I do. I always believe in helping the little guy, and you're the littlest guy I know."
5477,"No, it's Homer."
5478,I'm just waitin' for my kid.
5479,"Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention..."
5480,"Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield."
5481,"DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!"
5482,Dig up his grave! Pull out his tongue!
5483,What do we win if the tongue is there?
5484,What a jip.
5485,"Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home."
5486,No! Nooooooo!!
5487,"Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
5488,Get lost!
5489,"Hear ye, HEAR YE, HEAR YE!!"
5490,All right! Liver!
5491,I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.
5492,"Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?"
5493,"Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?"
5494,Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a hundred million years old!
5495,"Heh, heh. Taft, you old dog..."
5496,"Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't understand 2700 of my new duties."
5497,"Um, what do I do in case of fire?"
5498,Just my luck.
5499,"Uh, Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his replacement, Homer Simpson."
5500,But I think the dodo went extinct...
5501,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?"
5502,Lousy two-legged pants.
5503,I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
5504,Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker.
5505,"Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!"
5506,Uh... they all won.
5507,"Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep."
5508,"Yes, Sir, I did."
5509,The accounting department is located on the third floor. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The head of this department is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone.
5510,"Here are your messages: ""You have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""You have 10 minutes,"" ""Your car has been impounded,"" ""Your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""You have 30 minutes to move your cube."""
5511,Hello. Mr. Burns' office.
5512,It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.
5513,"Yes! Yes, sir!"
5514,"I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir."
5515,"No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division."
5516,Yello?... It's for you.
5517,No.
5518,Except... I killed Mr. Burns.
5519,I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.
5520,Mr. Burns?
5521,"I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt on that eye."
5522,"Yes, sir."
5523,"Hi, Mr. Burns. Do you want your coffee now?"
5524,"Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's five o'clock."
5525,"Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?"
5526,"Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?"
5527,You shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
5528,"I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how you'd feel, Marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do."
5529,"Mr. Smithers, wait!"
5530,"You can't let yourself end up in a place like this. You've got two choices: You can give up on yourself and take the Barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. Or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
5531,"Okay, I gotcha covered."
5532,You're on.
5533,Got it.
5534,"I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns."
5535,Uh-oh.
5536,"Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother."
5537,"Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say I don't love you. You are a bad son, Montel!"
5538,"You really blew it this time, Smithers."
5539,Okay.
5540,I'll show you.
5541,For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.
5542,What am I -- a doctor?
5543,"Bye, kids. On your way back, pick up a six pack of beer."
5544,"Oh, why can't they just take the gun?"
5545,Will do.
5546,"Aw, nertz."
5547,Which one's Itchy? The car?
5548,Oh. I guess that's not him then.
5549,"Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger."
5550,All right... Wait a minute. For what?
5551,Forget it.
5552,Okay. Grampa.
5553,Okay.
5554,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge! A couple of bucks!"
5555,What for?
5556,Oh... Forget it.
5557,"Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I don't know."
5558,"Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
5559,"You know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? Those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? Why I heard..."
5560,Troy McClure? He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels.
5561,"Oh, I love legitimate theater."
5562,Down in front!
5563,"I know! I know! It's Selma, right?"
5564,"Aw, hell. Well... What about Dracula?"
5565,"Troy, buddy, I gotta know. What's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like Selma?"
5566,Okay.
5567,"Hey, look what I snagged, Marge -- the candy bride and groom from the wedding cake."
5568,Mmmm... pointy.
5569,"That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle."
5570,"Marge, could you close your eyes? I'm trying to sleep."
5571,'Cause they won't hire an assistant.
5572,Donut?
5573,This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.
5574,"Uh... Oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. As a safety inspector, I am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs."
5575,I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
5576,I don't know.
5577,"Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!"
5578,"Oh, Diablo Canyon 2... Why can't you be more like Diablo Canyon 1?"
5579,"Hi, Lisa. How's your Spring Break going?"
5580,"Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me..."
5581,You made it! Did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?
5582,Great! Ya wanna get some lunch?
5583,"The way I figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs."
5584,"Well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here I trust. Ready?"
5585,They all have hilarious names and are delicious.
5586,"Boy, Lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you."
5587,"Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."
5588,Eh... Truth. Ask me anything.
5589,"All right, dare."
5590,"Hello, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball? First name, Ura?"
5591,"What?! How dare you! If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to Iran!"
5592,"Okay, your turn."
5593,Ummm... Do you have a crush on anyone?
5594,I won't tell anybody.
5595,"Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows! Well, just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secrets."
5596,I have no idea who that is.
5597,"I've already forgotten his name. It was Larsen something, right?"
5598,"What's wrong, honey?"
5599,"Uh, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend."
5600,I promise.
5601,"Yes, that's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment?"
5602,"All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, and then I will murder him."
5603,"Okay, we'll work this out together. First things first: where is Knoxville?"
5604,"Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge..."
5605,"Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console."
5606,"And have it sent to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, care of Homer J.--"
5607,Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of... Langdon Alger.
5608,Helms Calls for Donut Tax?!
5609,There. Done and done.
5610,"Oh, why did I have to stop at the railroad tracks? Better get some change."
5611,"It's okay. It's okay. I'm back. See, Daddy's here."
5612,"C'mon, Maggie, maybe if you just squeeze a little..."
5613,"That's it, that's it, I..."
5614,"Okay. Okay. Think, Homer..."
5615,... The dog!
5616,"Okay! Go, boy! Go find help! Go find help, boy!"
5617,"Oh, bad dog! Bad dog!"
5618,"Oh, don't worry, Maggie! I'll think of something!"
5619,Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.
5620,"Second class? What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet."
5621,Who is it?
5622,Bart's room.
5623,Where are you two going at this hour?
5624,"Oh, can I come?"
5625,Pass.
5626,"Looks like bad news for the... ...""Impson"" family."
5627,"Let's all calm down. Everyone's going to be just fine, as long as I've got enough beer."
5628,"All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer."
5629,Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
5630,I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
5631,"Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?"
5632,WE'RE HERE! WE'RE QUEER! WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BEARS!
5633,"Oh, I heard it at the Mustache Parade they have every year."
5634,"Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears."
5635,"Ahh, not a bear in sight. The bear patrol must be working like a charm."
5636,"Thank you, Honey."
5637,"Oh, how does it work?"
5638,Uh-huh.
5639,Uh-huh.
5640,"Lisa, I want to buy your rock."
5641,"Woo-hoo! A perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!"
5642,Hey... how come my pay is so low?
5643,Bear Patrol Tax: $5?! What?! This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history!
5644,Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer Tax.
5645,"Well, anyway, I'm still outraged."
5646,"Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn."
5647,"Yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular Joes like you and me, Apu."
5648,You? Pfft. I don't believe it.
5649,"Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about."
5650,"You know what, Apu... I am really, really gonna miss you."
5651,Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.
5652,"Low and lazy, so -- Hey! Say something again."
5653,"Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue."
5654,Don't forget Ganesha.
5655,"Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
5656,I never should have bought this button. Can I have my three dollars back?
5657,"Hey Marge, look what I brought home."
5658,"No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake."
5659,And I'm not registered!
5660,"Hello, Selma? Selma my dear? How are you? Uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... Listen, shut up for a second. How would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported?"
5661,"Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor."
5662,Please identify this object.
5663,Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?
5664,Uh... partial credit.
5665,"Now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the U.S, so let's do that. Uh, Springfield, Springfield... Ah, right here."
5666,"No, no, and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college."
5667,"Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history."
5668,What?
5669,"Yeah, native Americans like us."
5670,"Hi, everyone. If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker."
5671,"Now that you're all relaxed... Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
5672,They're writing the operas that entertain us every day...
5673,"They're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society."
5674,"If we pass Proposition 24, we'll be losing some of the truest Americans of all."
5675,"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!"
5676,NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO - ON - TWEN - TY - FOUR!
5677,When are people going to learn -- Democracy doesn't work!
5678,Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!
5679,"So how 'bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?"
5680,"Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?"
5681,"I see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""..."
5682,"I'm watching the road, sweetie. ""You jiiive turkey!"" See? You got to ""sass"" it. ""Quit jiiiving me, turkey!"" You gotta ""sass"" it. A turkey is a bad person."
5683,"But this is Grand Funk Railroad! You guys back there know Grand Funk, right?"
5684,"Nobody knows the band, Grand Funk? The wild shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner? The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher? The competent drumwork of Don Brewer? Oh, man."
5685,"For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!"
5686,"And when I listen to a really good song, I start nodding my head, like I'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""Yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" And then sometimes I switch it up like ""No, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""
5687,"No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music."
5688,"Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft..."
5689,I'm just trying to party with you guys.
5690,"Hi there! Been a while since I set foot in Good Vibrations Music. Where can I find the latest releases by ""Bread?"""
5691,Oldies?
5692,"But you've got all the top bands in here. Styx? I just heard them on ""The King Biscuit Flour Hour."" Now here are some of your no-name bands: Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, Hullabalooza..."
5693,"There can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the US Festival."
5694,The US Festival! Geez! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers.
5695,Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact.
5696,"Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible."
5697,"But most of all, I remember the music."
5698,You make me feel like dancing...
5699,"You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it."
5700,"No way, man. We're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever..."
5701,Forever... forever... forever...
5702,"I went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music I'd never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy."
5703,"That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
5704,I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age. Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
5705,Well... what have we here? Looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to Hullabalooza.
5706,"You're not going to school today. Today, your classroom will be the Capitol City Amphitheater. Your teacher? Four dozen rock bands. So get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. Woo hoo!"
5707,"Oh, my homemade Kahlua."
5708,"Hey, a freak show!"
5709,"Oh, I get it."
5710,"Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born."
5711,"Well, excuuuuuuse me!"
5712,"Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people."
5713,Alright. Yeah.
5714,"Cool concert, am I right?"
5715,What did I say? What's going on?
5716,"Okay, I'm heading out now! More butt support! More butt support!"
5717,"Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise."
5718,I'll never be part of the scene again!
5719,Uh-oh.
5720,I'm fine.
5721,"I don't think I have a choice, Marge."
5722,How do you figure?
5723,"You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different people..."
5724,"Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?"
5725,Thank you. Thank you very much.
5726,"""Stay in school. Your hero, Homer."""
5727,"Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide."
5728,All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...
5729,Our first job is to entertain...
5730,...and I like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.
5731,"But the main thing is, I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics."
5732,Woo hoo!
5733,"Hello, ticket-holders!"
5734,"Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!"
5735,"We've got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down; if it's black, send it back."
5736,"Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors."
5737,"Anyway, get ready, beer belly! We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of!"
5738,That was odd.
5739,No biggie. I'm cool.
5740,Rules. I'm a rocker. I don't care for rules.
5741,"Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dying would be a stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?"
5742,"People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great."
5743,Nope.
5744,"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity."
5745,What's with all the questions?
5746,"Sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do."
5747,...so I realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.
5748,"Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper."
5749,"Oh, I'm gonna die."
5750,"Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a club sandwich."
5751,You have a desk?
5752,"I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for."
5753,"You know what the song says, ""It's hip to be square."""
5754,So lame that it's cool?
5755,"Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool."
5756,I only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?
5757,"Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little."
5758,"Lisa, let's go!"
5759,"Hey. Hmm, somebody's travelin' light."
5760,"Well, I have been eating more..."
5761,"Bye-bye, job."
5762,"""Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons."" Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly."""
5763,I left a few helpful notes around the house...
5764,I'll take that.
5765,"I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised."
5766,Hello.
5767,"It's low tide, boys."
5768,"Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge."
5769,"Hey, he looks just like you, Poindexter!"
5770,"You've got friends. You got ""The Dud"" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter!"
5771,"Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time."
5772,"Um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. No, make it two."
5773,All right.
5774,"This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches."
5775,No lighter?... Nothin'?
5776,"Wait, I got it."
5777,The beer!
5778,Sweet merciful crap! My car!
5779,"Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids."
5780,"Attic? Oh, that's silly. Seriously, though, don't ever go up there."
5781,"Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it."
5782,"Fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo..."
5783,No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?
5784,"Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?"
5785,"See, Marge? Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain."
5786,"Oh my God, Marge, it's escaped!"
5787,"Lisa, please. Yes, Bart, you have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity."
5788,We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
5789,"We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
5790,"Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game."
5791,We think we saw Hugo at the airport! He was boarding a plane to Switzerland and... Oh.
5792,"Lookin' good, son."
5793,"Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish."
5794,"Come on, you stupid fish! Take the bait! Don't make me come down there!"
5795,What the-- whosa-- sonofa-
5796,Oh my God... space aliens! Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat them!
5797,"I suppose you'll want to probe me. Well, might as well get it over with."
5798,"I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around Washington, D.C."
5799,"Except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh, Mumbly-Joe... uh, I saw him on TV the other... Uh, Bob Dole."
5800,Oh no. Aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!
5801,No! NO! What are you spraying me with!?
5802,"Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!"
5803,That's one of the creatures!
5804,These candidates make me want to vomit in terror! I've got to stop them!
5805,Stop! Those candidates are phonies!
5806,You heard me -- They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
5807,"Oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?"
5808,Hold on guys. I'll help ya!
5809,"I'm Homer Simpson, Sir, and I'm gonna get you back to Washington before it's too late!"
5810,Oh no! What have I done? What am I doing? What will I do?!
5811,It's in Cypress Creek. Upstate somewhere.
5812,"Oh yeah. So long, Stinktown."
5813,"America, take a good look at your beloved candidates! They're nothing but hideous space reptiles!"
5814,Don't blame me. I voted for Kodos.
5815,"Marge! I've got a new job! It's with Globex Corporation. I get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. And they'll move us and give us a nice house and..."
5816,Of course not. I wouldn't do that. Why not?
5817,"But Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream."
5818,Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.
5819,"Just bring the rut with you, honey. Come on, take a look."
5820,"Ah, let's watch something else."
5821,"Oh yeah, that's right. Let's watch this."
5822,"Well! What do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?"
5823,Thank you! Come again!
5824,We'll never sell this rotten dump.
5825,Heeeeey...
5826,Yes.
5827,Okily dokily.
5828,I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.
5829,"Here we are, 15201 Maple Systems Road... Our new home."
5830,Wow! My boss!
5831,Okay...
5832,"Yes, once."
5833,Wowww.
5834,"Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion."
5835,Wow.
5836,Uh... to work for you?
5837,Um... Someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys.
5838,Yeah.
5839,Ye... No.
5840,Don't worry. That won't take long.
5841,All right.
5842,Doh!
5843,Are you guys working?
5844,"Could you, um... work any harder than this?"
5845,"Hey, call me Homer."
5846,"Hey, what's with you sad sacks?"
5847,"Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."
5848,"Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! ""To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry."""
5849,I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!
5850,"All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
5851,"Hey, if Tom Landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then I should just quit right now."
5852,"Tired, eh? What you guys need... is hammocks."
5853,All right... What's the number?
5854,"Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks."
5855,Uh-huh.
5856,Got it...
5857,Umm-hmmm...
5858,Yes...
5859,Right...
5860,"Oh, the Hammock District."
5861,Fine.
5862,Yes.
5863,Oh.
5864,No?
5865,Any sugar around here?
5866,Uh... yessir. No problemo.
5867,France.
5868,I've never noticed this office before.
5869,"Eh, you have any sugar around here?"
5870,Eh... I... no.
5871,Aargh!
5872,Well...
5873,I tackled a loafer at work today.
5874,"Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You haven't even gotten in trouble at school."
5875,"What?! We've got it great here. And for the first time in my life, I'm actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions."
5876,"Uh, I've got a problem, Hank."
5877,"Well, it's pretty important."
5878,"Say, what's going on?"
5879,"Aw, those jerks. Always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government."
5880,"Well, my family wants to move back to Springfield."
5881,Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.
5882,"Well... Thanks for everything, Hank."
5883,"""Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."""
5884,"Aw, the Denver Broncos."
5885,Yeah yeah.
5886,"You just don't understand football, Marge."
5887,"Look, Marge! They opened a new high-tech gadget store! You love high-tech gadgets!"
5888,Like bull you don't! Come on!
5889,"No, I'm not!"
5890,"Marge, look!"
5891,The World's Best Jacket! If I had this it would show everybody... show everybody!
5892,"Hey, what happened to your belt?"
5893,"Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start."
5894,"Yesss, they are a clever bunch. I know, I'll squeal for you. To their parents."
5895,The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
5896,Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
5897,Really?
5898,Dressing?
5899,You really think I could do it?
5900,Yes!
5901,Yes!
5902,YES!!
5903,Woo hoo!
5904,Wow! I've never been in here before!
5905,You used to be a boxer just like me?
5906,"Hey, what's this?"
5907,"You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he looks just like him, too."
5908,Why not?
5909,Lousy Democrats.
5910,No problemo.
5911,"Oh, why me?"
5912,Just a second.
5913,All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All right... Wait a minute... Just a sec...
5914,Then I can just push him over.
5915,No one.
5916,Never.
5917,Nothing.
5918,"Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?"
5919,"Gee, thanks, Moe... What's this?"
5920,You... didn't?
5921,"Uh, sure."
5922,"Ooh, ""General!"" Who's Drederick Tatum, anyway? Is he another hobo?"
5923,"Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance."
5924,"Uh, well... I was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!"
5925,"Aw, c'mon, I'll make a fortune for one night's work! We could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --"
5926,"Marge, will you let me finish? ...Plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --"
5927,"Well, I don't think it's that unlikely."
5928,"All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr. Newspaper today."
5929,Gotcha.
5930,"Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about... just--"
5931,Are you an angel?
5932,But you stopped the fight. Won't everyone be mad at you?
5933,"Aaar, matey."
5934,I can't remember where we parked.
5935,"Eh, not mine."
5936,Where are you going?
5937,"Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today."
5938,Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
5939,Can't they get a pole for that sign?
5940,"Ooh, let's pick him up!"
5941,And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.
5942,"Oh, yes we are!"
5943,"Oh, yes, there is!"
5944,"And I think it's the best idea I've ever had! We're picking up the weirdo, and that's final."
5945,He made fun of my weight.
5946,"Hey, you're that hitchhiker! What are you doing here?"
5947,"Wow, that's really lazy."
5948,So lazy.
5949,"...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry!"
5950,Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
5951,"Yes, sir. I do."
5952,"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who..."
5953,"Eh, I should go."
5954,It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.
5955,"Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. And that... is a phony kidnapping."
5956,Pho-ny kid-napping...
5957,"Hiding out? Marge, you've been reading too many hideout books."
5958,Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
5959,"Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?"
5960,"If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today."
5961,Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money!
5962,Just a second.
5963,No!
5964,"Marge, it's not a real kidnapping. It's a simple hoax to win a father's love."
5965,Still?
5966,"What... But... Marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!"
5967,The abandoned warehouse!
5968,Stupid economic recovery!
5969,We've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. Hel-lo!
5970,"Heh-heh, they'll never look for us here."
5971,"You don't like it, call the cops!"
5972,"It'll be okay, honey. There's lots more oil where that came from."
5973,"Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love."
5974,"I'm a father myself, sir. And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --"
5975,-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.
5976,"It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense."
5977,"Sorry, sorry. My fault."
5978,Someone found my keys!
5979,No problem... Can do.
5980,Right... Uh huh... Gotcha... Cat in the furnace.
5981,A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.
5982,"You know, I don't know."
5983,All right. Just wake me up.
5984,"No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda."
5985,"Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something."
5986,Do I have to sit up?
5987,Knock yourself out.
5988,Just a minute!
5989,Hello.
5990,I have misplaced my pants.
5991,"'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him."
5992,"No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day."
5993,"Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?"
5994,"C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit."
5995,"Yeah, well, I still get to punish you."
5996,"Now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. It's called responsibility."
5997,"I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten."
5998,"Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!"
5999,"What the... ""President Eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... Not pictured: Mrs. Eisenhower."""
6000,I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --
6001,working... so... late... that...
6002,"Yes, everyone loves rules..."
6003,"Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs."
6004,"Uh, this isn't gonna be about Jesus, is it?"
6005,"Helen, as a responsible parent, I was already well aware of that."
6006,"Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's..."
6007,"Hi! Now, Marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about Bart working in a burlesque house..."
6008,No! I only learned that four days ago.
6009,"I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!"
6010,"Don't you worry, son."
6011,My friends! Stop!
6012,"Sure, we could tear this house down..."
6013,No! My friends! Stop!
6014,"Let me finish. We could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves..."
6015,"You could close down Moe's or the Kwik-E-Mart, and nobody would care / But the heart and soul of Springfield's in our Maison Derriere..."
6016,"What are you doing, Marge? Didn't you hear the song?"
6017,Take it off!
6018,Hey...
6019,Easy...
6020,"Marge, can't we get some clear plates? I can't see the TV."
6021,Yoink.
6022,"Keep it down in there, everybody."
6023,"Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."
6024,"Oh, I hate having parties. The toilet always gets backed up."
6025,"Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?"
6026,"Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here."
6027,Whaaaaaat?!
6028,I just gotta put my shoes on.
6029,"You know what you two need? A little comic strip called ""Love Is."" It's about two naked eight year olds who are married."
6030,Shut up and let the woman talk.
6031,Boring!
6032,"Ooh, here we go!"
6033,That's a door?
6034,"G'night... Thanks for coming... We'll see you... Ba-bye... Well, I think that went pretty well."
6035,"Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago."
6036,You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on.
6037,The one down the hall.
6038,I sleep in a big bed with my wife.
6039,Thanks for introducing me.
6040,What the hell is wrong with you?!!
6041,For what?
6042,I don't wanna go to that.
6043,That doesn't sound like something I'd say.
6044,Okay. Love you.
6045,"Can I Borrow A Feeling? ""Can I Borrow A Feeling?"" There's your picture on the front."
6046,I already did.
6047,Oh yeah. You gotta do that.
6048,"Oh, and for yourself."
6049,It can't just be sex. It can't.
6050,"Ooh, that's tough, pal. But it's never going to happen to me."
6051,'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
6052,"Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner!"
6053,"""Dear Homer,"" aww. ""Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I left you hot dogs for dinner. They're thawing in the sink."""
6054,"Lisa, wait! I know you're only eight years old and I don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage."
6055,All right.
6056,"As you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and I think your mom might not be happy with me."
6057,'Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
6058,Mm-hm.
6059,"Oh, I knew this would happen. Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot."
6060,That's your advice?! Go to bed!
6061,"Good morning. You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests, so I wandered over to that theater you went to last night. And I bought tickets to their entire season."
6062,"Look -- ""Mostly Madrigals."" Hey, that might be good. Ooh, ooh, ""An Evening With Philip Glass."" Just an evening? ""Voices of the Elderly Poor."""
6063,"Oh, of course, my sweet. I'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you."
6064,I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. How many husbands would do that for their wives?
6065,Ooh! You're feisty. I'm gonna give you a Madonna cut.
6066,"Oh, I've just made things worse. A few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. Marge deserves someone who will treat her right. Marge deserves a fresh start."
6067,"I'd like to file, for divorce."
6068,Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.
6069,"Marge, will you marry me?"
6070,"No, it's a second wedding, Honey. Our first one was so crummy, I had to make it up to you. I really love you."
6071,"Yes, we do. I got us a divorce this afternoon."
6072,"I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV. This one is for real. I want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like Kirk and Luann."
6073,Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.
6074,"Okay, ready."
6075,It doesn't matter. All I want to know is: Will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?
6076,"Eh, mornin', Apu."
6077,Whaddya mean?
6078,"Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was."
6079,"Hey, what's this thing?"
6080,"Telemarketing, eh?"
6081,I won't.
6082,Let me show you how it works. This baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. It automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. Listen.
6083,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right now. So use it. And send one dollar to Happy Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. Don't delay! Eternal happiness is just a dollar away."
6084,Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
6085,Tele-panhandling.
6086,Woo hoo! Two dollars! It's working!
6087,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right... Etc."
6088,"Oh, no you don't!"
6089,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as..."
6090,"Greetings, friend..."
6091,Friend...
6092,Will you two shut up?! People are trying to sleep!!
6093,Lisa's window is the next one!
6094,"Greetings, friend..."
6095,Shut up!!
6096,"Hey, who shot the auto-dialer? Marge's auto-dialer?"
6097,"Hello, this is Homer Simpson, a.k.a. ""Happy Dude."" The court has ordered me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam. I'm sorry. If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, send one dollar to Sorry Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield... You have the power."
6098,... Is it... Wah?
6099,"Oh, Lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield."
6100,"What is it, boy? Fire? Earthquake? Hippies?"
6101,Hurricane! Somehow the animals are always the first to know.
6102,"Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel."
6103,I would make it my business to be a third wheel.
6104,"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!"
6105,Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
6106,"All clear, everyone."
6107,Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?
6108,See? I told you it was over.
6109,Hmm. I don't remember a bowling alley being th--
6110,"He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!"
6111,Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
6112,Talk to me!!
6113,"Well, call us if you need anything."
6114,"Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love."
6115,The living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...
6116,"Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad."
6117,"Your beautiful kitchen, Ned. Just as you remember it."
6118,"So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?"
6119,"Aw, shoot."
6120,"Hey, I got off pretty easy."
6121,Beer! Gimme some beer!
6122,"Yello? Yes... Mental hospital? I don't know any ""Ned Flanders."""
6123,"Oh, him."
6124,I... What?
6125,"""Ned Flanders, I mock your value system. You also appear foolish in the eyes of others."""
6126,Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.
6127,I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?
6128,"Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly."
6129,"You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human."
6130,Because humans are obnoxious sometimes. Humans hate things.
6131,"C'mon, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites?"
6132,"What about, uh, fluorescent lights?"
6133,See? You like everything.
6134,"Ned, you so crazy."
6135,"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!"""
6136,"Hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
6137,"Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?"
6138,Where? To the big annual what?
6139,"Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper."
6140,"Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off..."
6141,"Hey, Marge, you don't smoke!"
6142,You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.
6143,"What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!"
6144,I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it!
6145,Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud!
6146,"Oh, well, of course... everything looks bad if you remember it. Now where are my chili boots? Ah!"
6147,"Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?"
6148,"Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!"
6149,Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.
6150,Stupor Pooper.
6151,"Five-alarm chili, eh?"
6152,"One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?"
6153,"Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh."
6154,"Hello, Chief."
6155,"Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold."
6156,Hot! Hot!
6157,But I need it!
6158,"Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss..."
6159,"Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do."
6160,Outstanding.
6161,"More, please."
6162,"Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
6163,"Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it."
6164,Ooh. I don't feel so good.
6165,Flanders! You gotta help me!
6166,"What's happening to me? Okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with Marge, ate Guatemalan insanity peppers. Then I -- Ohhhh."
6167,Where am I? Shelbyville?
6168,"Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you!"
6169,"Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils..."
6170,Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now.
6171,"Huh? Sunrise, sunset... Sunrise, sunset... SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET..."
6172,Note to self: stop doing anything.
6173,Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks!
6174,Huh? A tortoise?
6175,Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up!
6176,"Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on!"
6177,"Oh. You want me to climb that, huh? No problemo."
6178,"This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?"
6179,Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car?
6180,"Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad."
6181,"Aw, I hate this place! Why am I here?!"
6182,Who said that?
6183,Hiya.
6184,"If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you."
6185,"Yeah, that's me all right."
6186,But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions?
6187,"You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!!"
6188,Knock it off!
6189,"Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya."
6190,Soul mate?
6191,"That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge."
6192,"Hey, wait! Come back!..."
6193,A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none!
6194,"Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!"
6195,Carl?
6196,And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
6197,"Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog."
6198,Damn straight.
6199,"Hi, kids."
6200,Where's your mother?
6201,"Hi, honey."
6202,Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't come home last night...
6203,"Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate."
6204,Okay.
6205,"That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common..."
6206,"Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason..."
6207,"Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here."
6208,"...I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking?"
6209,"Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer."
6210,"Well what about you, Lenny?"
6211,"Hello? Is this G-B-M? Uh, yeah. I read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, I also like rainy days and movies. Uh huh... uh, no, I don't like that. Or that. No, it's not that I'm afraid. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye-bye. Oh, I give up."
6212,Where? Where?!
6213,Huh. What's that blinking light?
6214,The lighthouse keeper!
6215,The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me!
6216,Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!
6217,"Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl...."
6218,"A machine? Earl's a machine. Oh, that's just perfect! Homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! Oh, wow!"
6219,"Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
6220,A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends!
6221,"Come here, people!"
6222,"Well, I won't be lonely for long...."
6223,Marge?
6224,Really? You were? But how did you find me?
6225,"Or that little guy on the ""Don't Walk"" sign."
6226,"Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because..."
6227,"Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus..."
6228,"Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters."
6229,...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...
6230,"Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!"
6231,"We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote!"
6232,Omigod! The ship!
6233,The light! We gotta get the light back on!
6234,They see us! They're starting to turn!
6235,We sure did... soul mate.
6236,"TGIF! Guys, I'm off to Moe's."
6237,"Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called ""The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down."" First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so..."
6238,"Then, I insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop..."
6239,"Nah, it's Friday night Moe. I wanna try something special."
6240,Skoal! Wait a minute -- this is Duff!
6241,"Hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something I can't quite put my finger on."
6242,"Well, it's one a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids."
6243,"Eh, I guess I'll walk home."
6244,"No time for you, old man!"
6245,"Please, don't hurt me!"
6246,Yaaaa...
6247,Uh!
6248,"It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, ""Don't be afraid!"""
6249,"No! Well, ten beers..."
6250,"I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet."
6251,"Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo! Explain that!"
6252,So?
6253,Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
6254,"Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's?"
6255,Lousy loveable dog.
6256,"Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes and the -- oh wait, that was my physical."
6257,The alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night -- like Urkel!
6258,You don't have to humiliate me.
6259,"No, I'm sorry."
6260,Yes.
6261,Ow.
6262,"Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon."
6263,We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?
6264,"You are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that."
6265,"I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God, I love her. I-- Hey, a penny!"
6266,"So I says ""Blue M & M, red M & M, they all wind up the same color in the end."""
6267,"I was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods."
6268,"Oh, Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""I believe you, Homer."""
6269,"You do?! Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!"
6270,Thanks! I'd love an omelet right about now.
6271,"No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed?"
6272,"No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous?"
6273,"Well then, good night!"
6274,"Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too."
6275,You do?
6276,"Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?"
6277,"That's my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!"
6278,We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.
6279,"Now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too."
6280,I kill me.
6281,"Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for Daddies, and kids with fake IDs... besides, it's such a beautiful night. How about a ghost story?"
6282,No! No! No-o-o-o-o!
6283,"Yeah, me too."
6284,It's him!
6285,"As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say..."
6286,Bwah! Bwah! Bwaaaaah!
6287,It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.
6288,"Good work, son! We did it! We did it!"
6289,Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape!
6290,"Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Doctor Hibbert?"
6291,Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.
6292,"Uh, yes."
6293,This interview is over!
6294,"Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any ""Homer is a Dope"" T-shirts, do you?"
6295,Marge! How could you?
6296,I'll take two!
6297,Look! There it is!
6298,"Thanks, Marge."
6299,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. When are the pancakes coming in the mail?"
6300,"What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about."
6301,Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.
6302,"No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!"
6303,Oh yeah.
6304,"Uh, your fish are dead."
6305,"Hey, pretzels!"
6306,"Hey, what's all that commotion outside? Why, it's one of those Pretzel Wagons the movie stars are always talking about."
6307,"That's right, Lenny. Let's all give in to deliciousness, the Pretzel Wagon way."
6308,"That means thank you, Marge."
6309,You could call 'em Whitey Whackers.
6310,"Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can..."
6311,"Aw, looks like Mr. Pretzel Man is doing pretty well for himself."
6312,I'm here to see Mr. Ormand.
6313,"Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of his estate."
6314,"You're my last hope. I've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. Your help could make all the difference in the world."
6315,"I had a feeling things would work out for you, honey."
6316,"Thanks, Moe."
6317,"Yeah, my wife is raking it in."
6318,"Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?"
6319,"You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... I will say good day to you, sir."
6320,In those words? Yes.
6321,How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.
6322,So what are we gonna do?
6323,"Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa."
6324,Now what?
6325,"You heard her. She said ""no."""
6326,"But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet."
6327,Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you know it's gonna be good!
6328,"You must hate me, Marge. Every time I try to help, I just fail miserably."
6329,"Hey, that's the fire alarm!"
6330,"I think I won, Mr. Burns."
6331,Woo hoo!
6332,"Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!"
6333,So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. Which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.
6334,Huh?
6335,"Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but I think we have to go on the retreat anyway."
6336,"Well, here we are."
6337,Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
6338,"Uh, I lost my map."
6339,"Hey, this sounds like fun."
6340,Uh-oh.
6341,Oooh.
6342,"Uh, not as such."
6343,"Yes, lotta hysteria..."
6344,"Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!"
6345,"Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns."
6346,No sir. I am not.
6347,That worked sooo well.
6348,No going through the window for us!
6349,"You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny."
6350,"Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs."
6351,"Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this?"
6352,Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tinkering with. Say I want that bowl of dip.
6353,Oh?
6354,"Use it wisely, my friend."
6355,"You got it, buddy."
6356,"Um, I don't see one. Unless..."
6357,No. There's no way out.
6358,You can supervise me.
6359,We sure did!
6360,I think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
6361,Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .
6362,I think they've stopped. .
6363,So what?
6364,It could be days before they find us.
6365,We could build snowmen.
6366,Oh... Okay.
6367,"Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!"
6368,Agreed.
6369,"Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns."
6370,What do we do?
6371,You and what army?
6372,Burnsie!
6373,"Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house."
6374,"Marge, kids."
6375,"You said it, ya weirdo."
6376,"Marge, get me a beer."
6377,Your mother seems really upset about something. I better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.
6378,"Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers."
6379,Eww.
6380,"Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball on ESPN..."
6381,Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
6382,"Oh, There's no way I could --"
6383,"Now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. Just like my hair!"
6384,"Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it."
6385,But how am I supposed to pay for that?
6386,"Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar."
6387,"Didn't he Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute, he didn't!"
6388,"All right, Marge. I'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... I'll give up the Civil War Re-creation Society I love so much."
6389,"Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. This is a man in drag!"
6390,You're phony! Fakey phony broad!
6391,Gimme those.
6392,Sorry.
6393,I like him!
6394,I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.
6395,You have my undivided attention.
6396,MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.
6397,AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--
6398,Did you say Mary Pop--
6399,"Now Ms. Bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. First, do you have any bad habits?"
6400,"Well, so am I."
6401,Okay. Question two -- who was your last employer?
6402,"Marge, do we know them?"
6403,Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The black guy?
6404,"Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?"
6405,"Ooh, she is tough."
6406,I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.
6407,"Come to bed, Marge."
6408,"No, no. Leave it in."
6409,NOT TILL YOU'RE FIFTEEN.
6410,"Ooh, I can't get enough of this blood pudding."
6411,"Blood, uch! I'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank you."
6412,You've changed me as well. I'm no longer the money-driven workaholic I once was.
6413,You little...
6414,Shary Bobbins! I want another beer!
6415,You'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
6416,"Oh, that poor woman."
6417,Nope.
6418,Indubitably!
6419,"AROUND THE HOUSE, I NEVER LIFT A FINGER / AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER I'M SUB-PAR / I'D RATHER DRINK A BEER THAN WIN FATHER OF THE YEAR / I'M HAPPY WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE."
6420,"SHUT UP, FLANDERS."
6421,"I'm sure we will, honey."
6422,I'm sure we will.
6423,"Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie."
6424,I do not!
6425,I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
6426,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' ""Howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."
6427,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't sound like that, do I? Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice."
6428,Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog.
6429,"Oh, ""no attitude,"" eh? Not ""in-your-face,"" huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, Ugly!"
6430,Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.
6431,"Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog."
6432,"Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you."
6433,"She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again."
6434,You? But you're a lady.
6435,"Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?"
6436,"You mean ""meep meep""?"
6437,"Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?"
6438,"I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""Genius At Work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
6439,What the hell are you talking about?
6440,Quiet! You're missing the jokes!
6441,Well? What did everybody think?
6442,"So it was pretty okay, huh?"
6443,"Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?"
6444,I'm the worst Poochie ever.
6445,Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!
6446,"You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!"
6447,"Put a sock in it, Roy."
6448,No I am not.
6449,Never!
6450,"You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands."
6451,"Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
6452,"Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten Superbowls. I don't want to oversell it. Judge for yourselves."
6453,"Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!"
6454,"Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live and learn."
6455,"Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again."
6456,"Aw, nuts. Hel-lo? China? Little help?"
6457,That is so true.
6458,What happened?
6459,Give her a break! Her husband was killed!
6460,"Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!"
6461,Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.
6462,"No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? You're a grown man."
6463,"Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies."
6464,And that kind of stuff is worth money?
6465,"Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!"
6466,"I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock? The snacking hour?"
6467,Do I know you?
6468,Ow! Why you little...
6469,"Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat."
6470,"So, do those records have ""camp value?"""
6471,That John is the greatest guy in the world. We've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
6472,"Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there..."
6473,Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
6474,Who doesn't?
6475,Right...
6476,"OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced with a Gay! Marge, Lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. Promise me!"
6477,"Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property values! Now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!"
6478,"Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but because he's a sneak. He should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way."
6479,"You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming."
6480,"No! No, no, no, no..."
6481,"No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!"
6482,"How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened! He didn't give you Gay, did he? Did he?"
6483,"Oh, and I'm not."
6484,Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?
6485,Uhh... huh.
6486,"Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!"
6487,"There's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me."
6488,"Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is all your fault. I mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?"
6489,"All right, boy! Come on! Today we're gonna--"
6490,You! I should have known!
6491,"Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. Just stay the hell away from my family!"
6492,No.
6493,"You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!"
6494,"No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned the Navy into a floating joke! They ruined all our best names, like Bruce and Lance and Julian! Those were the toughest names we had, now they're just..."
6495,"Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent ""you people"" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!"
6496,Homer storms out.
6497,"Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight. By tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular Burt Reynolds."
6498,Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.
6499,"Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you."
6500,... as a father! A father!! A regular father!! Whooh!
6501,Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
6502,Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?
6503,That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. What's your brand?
6504,"Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will..."
6505,"Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"
6506,Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin' what they do best.
6507,You'll thank me on your wedding night.
6508,Has the whole world gone insane?
6509,I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all sick!
6510,"Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!"
6511,"Oh, my God, what's happening now?"
6512,...and the entire steel mill was gay!
6513,But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!
6514,"Hunting, eh?"
6515,"Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hunting. He's going to grow up straight for once."
6516,Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?
6517,It just does! Name me one gay Indian!
6518,"Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know about hunting?"
6519,"Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!"
6520,"No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You're going hunting!"
6521,"That is a very immature attitude, young man."
6522,Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed yet! He hasn't even --
6523,"Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian."
6524,No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.
6525,"Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!"
6526,"Yep, and it's your shot, son."
6527,"C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?"
6528,"Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer."
6529,"Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!"
6530,"Me too, son."
6531,"Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!"
6532,UNNGHH!!
6533,Just... my bones... and organs...
6534,What the -- ?
6535,"Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!"
6536,It's a miracle!
6537,I've been tenderized.
6538,"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?"
6539,Amen to that.
6540,"Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
6541,"He said ""tried""!"
6542,"Oh, all those stairs..."
6543,"Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes --"
6544,"And sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --"
6545,In a medium-security prison.
6546,Unless he gets out somehow.
6547,"Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before."
6548,Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
6549,Lisa too?
6550,"Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your dinners."
6551,"Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!"
6552,"You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend."
6553,The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
6554,"Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses."
6555,"Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh..."
6556,I'll have to ask her.
6557,Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
6558,"Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all the mileage you can. Then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot."
6559,Can you see the pie stains?
6560,"Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says."
6561,"Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's practically no traffic!"
6562,"All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remember where we're parked."
6563,You've never been?
6564,"Nah, I'm really more of a slacker."
6565,"Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity!"
6566,"Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs."
6567,"You know, honey, when I think of all the good times we've had together-- AAAGH!"
6568,"Did you see that, Marge?"
6569,Don't laugh at me! I was once like you!
6570,"What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved Jello shooters."
6571,"Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. She's the responsible one."
6572,"Give me the drugs, Lisa."
6573,"It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm still not drunk yet. Oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock."
6574,"Oh, Moe, thank God you're here! We'd like to come in and drink, please!"
6575,Look at me! I'm the Prime Minister of Ireland!
6576,I'll come with you.
6577,"Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia?"
6578,Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
6579,"Glad you're finally back in business, Moe."
6580,"At first I thought prohibition was a good thing. People were drinking more and having a lot more fun. But without beer, prohibition doesn't work."
6581,No.
6582,Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life. And I aim to keep it!
6583,"Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do..."
6584,"C'mon, boy, think of a plan."
6585,I've got it!
6586,"We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back, avenge our deaths."
6587,"Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone."
6588,"Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope."
6589,"Hang on, son!"
6590,Really? I heard good.
6591,Nothin'.
6592,"Before! Before! You're living in the past, Marge! Quit living in the past."
6593,Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.
6594,"Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!"
6595,"Yeah, suck like a fox!"
6596,"You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism."
6597,"Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast was clear. Aw, it's probably clear. Let's go."
6598,"I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!"
6599,"Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's."
6600,Huh?
6601,"It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money I'm making!"
6602,No you won't.
6603,Won't.
6604,"Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!"
6605,Call me Beer Baron.
6606,But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!
6607,"Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpentine? Or caulk? Delicious caulk..."
6608,"""Make it,"" eh?"
6609,"Forty-two bathtubs, please."
6610,I said forty-two!
6611,"Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. We're patriots. Like... all those people in jail."
6612,"Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?"
6613,"Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner."
6614,"Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear."
6615,"What, dear?"
6616,Ka-BLAMMO.
6617,Boom.
6618,I'll be right back.
6619,It's hot!
6620,"I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit."
6621,"Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wonderful money."
6622,"Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible."
6623,"Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing."
6624,Poor Wiggum.
6625,"I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?"
6626,The guy who took your job.
6627,"Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?"
6628,"You forgot one thing, Wiggum."
6629,I filled the balls with a funnel.
6630,"Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist..."
6631,Last time I help you.
6632,"Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore."
6633,"To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
6634,"Alright, men. Get ready to blast off!"
6635,"Wooo, we're in orbit now! What's that? A call from the president? Hello?... Uh, yes. ""Let me just say this about that."" Okay, Mr. President..."
6636,Mayday! Mayday!
6637,"Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is ""Krabappel?"" I've been calling her ""Crandall."" Why didn't someone tell me? Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself."
6638,"Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house."
6639,It was in... It was in my pocket.
6640,"Hey, does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin, too?"
6641,"Marge, mail's here."
6642,When? When? Ich bin hungrig!
6643,"Yes! My precious ""CarTOONS!"" ""Who pumped Ethyl?!"""
6644,"Marge, mail's here."
6645,Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!
6646,"Oh, it smells like salmon, too! Thanks, boy!"
6647,"Hi Marge, hi Santa's Little Helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not Santa's Little Helper."
6648,"Wow, I gotta start going to church."
6649,"Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day."
6650,"Geez, that dog has more education than I do. He's some kinda super dog. Hey, where'd he go?"
6651,"Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty."
6652,Do you think he noticed?
6653,Who?
6654,"No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist his charms."
6655,Crowds give him gas.
6656,"Wow, TV's Kent Brockman."
6657,"You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?"
6658,"I'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable."
6659,Can do.
6660,"Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy baby?"
6661,Laddie?
6662,He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
6663,You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!
6664,"There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog."
6665,"Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
6666,Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.
6667,The bad dog or the good dog?
6668,Oh good.
6669,Marge!
6670,"Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!"
6671,"Oh, okay."
6672,Can Lenny have it?
6673,Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
6674,"Oh, yes! Gather 'round, my son, and I shall tell you a tale..."
6675,"No, the bank put Lenny in charge."
6676,"Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good."
6677,"Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling I can handle today."
6678,"Hey, why don't you try the old folks home? They practically live in their own filth!"
6679,"You're welcome, honey."
6680,You mean Maggie?
6681,Lisa! You have a guest!
6682,"So, um, how's life in the gutter?"
6683,"See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals?"
6684,It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.
6685,"Please be Flanders, please be Flanders, please be Flanders..."
6686,"Good one, Mom! / You're so bad, honey."
6687,Two in a row!
6688,Uh-huh.
6689,"Oh, I hope you learned your lesson, Lisa. Never help anyone."
6690,I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was so I'm watching TV.
6691,"Oh, I'd love to go with you, honey, but I've got a lot of work to do around the bed."
6692,"In that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. Lousy God."
6693,DAMMIT!!
6694,Who cares? This is the best part of the week!
6695,"It should, but it doesn't. Now who's going with Daddy to the dump?"
6696,Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.
6697,Wanna come with?
6698,It's your life.
6699,"C'mon, Christmas tree."
6700,Okay. Who's up for some scrounging?
6701,"Hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!"
6702,"Oh my God! Help me, Lisa!"
6703,Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?
6704,"Oh, my God, what is that?..."
6705,Why would you volunteer at the church?
6706,"Volunteering is for suckers! Do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?"
6707,"But Marge, I'm obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? How'd my face get on it?!"
6708,"Akira, can you read this for me?"
6709,"Hokkaido, eh?"
6710,"I'd like the phone book for Hokkaido, Japan, please."
6711,Thank you. May I please use your phone?
6712,Y-y-y-yes.
6713,Yes. This is Homer Simpson from America. Who may I say is speaking to me?
6714,"Uh, hello? Why am I Mr. Sparkle?"
6715,"Well, I am Mr. Sparkle!"
6716,Ow!
6717,Put it in! Put it in!
6718,"That didn't explain anything. All I know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid ""logo"". There's no other explanation."
6719,"Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. C'mon kids. Let's go home."
6720,That was fast.
6721,"Thanks for swinging by the house, Reverend."
6722,Konichi-wa.
6723,"No, run around in circles!"
6724,Now that's religion.
6725,Can I have this one?
6726,Chair goes round... chair goes round.
6727,Yes.
6728,I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy. I should probably go home sick.
6729,Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em. Just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.
6730,I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
6731,"Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."
6732,"Oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya."
6733,"Hiya, Stretch! What's the good word?"
6734,"Okay, Grimy!"
6735,Huh?
6736,"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry."
6737,Check.
6738,"So how's it going, Grimy?"
6739,"I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL! So what's new, Grimy?"
6740,Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.
6741,That got it.
6742,"Acid, eh? Gee, that would have been stupid. Boy would my face have been red!"
6743,He did.
6744,He likes you.
6745,"Hi, Grimy, old buddy."
6746,Okay. Do I have to do anything?
6747,"Oh, I can't believe it. I've got an enemy. Me! The most beloved man in Springfield."
6748,"No, I won't accept that."
6749,"Oh, what'll I do, Moe?"
6750,Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
6751,This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimy and me are going to be friends. Lisa -- be perfect.
6752,Marge -- perfect. Bart -- perfect. Other kid -- perfect.
6753,"No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here."
6754,It's him! It's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...
6755,Welcome-to-the-Simpson-residence-or-Casa-De-Simpson-as-I-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.
6756,It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.
6757,"This is my wife, Marge..."
6758,"... and our beautiful baby. My daughter, Lisa -- I.Q. 156."
6759,"See. And my son, Bart -- he owns a factory downtown."
6760,I 'unno. Don't ask me how the economy works.
6761,Wow.
6762,"Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space."
6763,Sure. You've never been?
6764,Would you like to see my Grammy Award?
6765,What?
6766,What are you saying?
6767,The car won't start. And I don't feel very good today. I am at work.
6768,"Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road."
6769,No he won't. He hates me.
6770,"Yeah, yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!"
6771,I'll do it. To professionalism!
6772,"Good morning, fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson."
6773,"Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am."
6774,"Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I've gone home to work on the contest."
6775,"Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?"
6776,"Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now..."
6777,Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance. And this racing stripe here I feel is pretty sharp.
6778,"Hey, you okay, Grimy?"
6779,You wish.
6780,"Change the channel, Marge."
6781,Over there.
6782,"Barney, where's my car?!!"
6783,"Ah, grrrreetings!"
6784,Dad? Is that really you?
6785,Call me when you get a karaoke machine.
6786,I'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
6787,"B-b-before the show, you said we were having a Special Ghost tonight!"
6788,What's a Tim Conway?
6789,"Marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?"
6790,"Honey, I'm home!"
6791,"It's not a plant, Marge, it's a tree, and I've nearly chewed through it. Now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight."
6792,"Okay. Now, before my boss comes, there's something important you should know --"
6793,"But, Marge...!"
6794,"Well, I know one thing in this world that's still pure and good."
6795,"No... Candy! Sweet, sweet candy."
6796,I WANT CANDY!
6797,I WANT CANDY!
6798,I wish our special guest Tim Conway didn't have to leave so soon.
6799,"Well, that's all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying: ""As you walk down the road of life..."""
6800,"You've really done it this time, Bart! You're in for the punishment of a lifetime!"
6801,"No, no! Your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage!"
6802,Not very.
6803,"Well, I'm sorry if you heard ""Disneyland"", but I distinctly said ""military school."""
6804,"If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?"
6805,They sure are.
6806,That's not so disciplined.
6807,I guess.
6808,Leggo my leg.
6809,"Son, for the last time, you're staying at military school."
6810,Marge? You got that? Marge?!
6811,"Hey, go on, boy. Go get it! Answer the phone! Be a good boy!"
6812,"Oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing."
6813,"Well, Bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?"
6814,"Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy could use more confidence."
6815,"Well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to Disneyland for real!"
6816,"'Evening, Moe."
6817,You got the black one.
6818,"Hey everybody, I'm Peter Pantsless!"
6819,"Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold!"
6820,"Goodnight, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. Just slide it under the door."
6821,"So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school."
6822,"Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts."
6823,Throw it away! Nothing good has ever come out of New York City!
6824,My vehicle!
6825,"Oh, I don't want to go to New York City."
6826,"New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes."
6827,It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City.
6828,All I had to do was walk a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my train at Penn Station...
6829,"Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life."
6830,And that's when the CHUDs came at me.
6831,"Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this!"
6832,Don't you start.
6833,"Marge, I can't feel my legs!"
6834,I can't feel my legs!
6835,Oh. Hi.
6836,"Now remember, criminals prey on small-town folk like us. So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated millionaires from the Ozarks."
6837,Good. I don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. You wait here at the bus station while I get the car.
6838,"Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy."
6839,I'm on to you!
6840,Your vehicle is illegally parked at One World Trade Plaza. Hmmm...
6841,Ooohh...
6842,Stupid city! What the hell is this thing?
6843,"Come off! Come off! Oh, all right, you!"
6844,Ow.
6845,"They expect me to sit here from nine to five?! That's how many hours? Ten, eleven, denominator... Oh, where's Lisa when you need her?"
6846,Come on! Pick up the pace!
6847,"Hey! I'm not a bum... Thanks, but I don't need... Okay, if you insist, but... Spare change, lady? Lousy cheapskate..."
6848,So hungry... can't leave car... Huh...
6849,Getting closer... closer...almost there... Ow!
6850,"Hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?"
6851,"Aw, shoot. All right, all right. Give me one bowl."
6852,Geez! That's just... awful!
6853,"Mmmm. Now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?"
6854,Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice.
6855,Uh-oh. Uhh... You got a men's room in there?
6856,"But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice?"
6857,Mmmmm.
6858,"Come on, boot guy!"
6859,Flushing Meadows...
6860,"Oh, I can't take it anymore. All right, I'll only be gone for a second."
6861,Frontsies... Backsies... I'm with them... V.I.P... Coming through... Very important person... They gave me frontsies...
6862,"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH. Oh, yes. Oh."
6863,"What? ""Failure to wait by vehicle: $250."""
6864,"Oh no, it's getting dark. Well, that's it. I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!"
6865,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
6866,It's gonna be dark soon. I'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.
6867,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
6868,"Aha! I've got it! Brain, how can I ever thank you?"
6869,Sorry.
6870,"Just a minute... Everything's under control... Yes, I'd be upset, too..."
6871,Hey! Hey! Hey!
6872,The boss says you're fired.
6873,"So long, Mr. Boot."
6874,Come o-o-on! Come o-o-on!
6875,Die! Die!
6876,"Homer one, New York nothing."
6877,Thanks for your patience!
6878,Ow!
6879,"We're getting outta here, now! Jump in, Marge! Trust me! Throw the kids! No time for the baby!"
6880,Come on! Let's go! Everyone into the car! Now!
6881,"We'll see, honey."
6882,We'll see.
6883,"Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm..."
6884,"Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son."
6885,"Or ""crapweeds""."
6886,"Not if they were called ""scumdrops""."
6887,Fair enough.
6888,"Okay, once more. Where are we going?"
6889,And why are you and the old lady in the car?
6890,And why is Marge here?
6891,And why am I here?
6892,And why are the kids here?
6893,And why is Grampa here?
6894,"Can I see your copy of ""Swank"", Armin?"
6895,"Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!"
6896,"All right, all right. So, he's a fraud. I don't care! His mom doesn't care! Do any of you care?"
6897,"Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let Sgt. Skinner keep his dignity."
6898,And we salute you for it. Now don't come back.
6899,Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?
6900,BOY THE WAY THE BEE GEES PLAYED...
6901,GUESSING HOW MUCH ELVIS WEIGHED...
6902,WATCHING SHOWS LIKE GENTLE BEN...
6903,"MISTER, WE COULD USE A MAN LIKE SHERIFF LOBO AGAIN."
6904,DISCO DUCK AND FLEETWOOD MAC...
6905,"Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin'?"
6906,What a bad father.
6907,"Lisa, knock off that racket!"
6908,I'll practice you!
6909,"Bart, make her stop."
6910,"Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad."
6911,"Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy something Bart loves."
6912,"Don't worry, son. If that bothers you, I'll destroy something Maggie loves."
6913,You don't remember how you got it?
6914,"Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school..."
6915,"Now, son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me..."
6916,Lousy traumatic childhood.
6917,BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE...
6918,"And that, my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school."
6919,Yeah.
6920,No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time!
6921,"Oh, my father gave me beer as a child. Till I wrapped my little red wagon around a tree."
6922,And we never did.
6923,Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
6924,"Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!"
6925,"Oh, all right. What a- Burn it! Send it to Hell!"
6926,Get it away!
6927,"Bart, son. You wanna play catch?"
6928,"When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong."
6929,Get the hell out.
6930,Wait a minute... she's right!
6931,"Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future."
6932,Wow. Just think of the possibilities.
6933,Nah.
6934,Hm.
6935,"Well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her."
6936,I'll give ya fifty bucks.
6937,Seventy-five.
6938,"Excellente! Muchas gracias, Señorata!"
6939,Ah so.
6940,"Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste."
6941,You do that.
6942,"Dad, what are you doin' here?"
6943,Ohhh. So hottt.
6944,"Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?"
6945,"You lose, Michelangelo's David. Who's next?"
6946,Unless what?
6947,"Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
6948,"Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning."
6949,No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
6950,"Up up up up up up up. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?"
6951,"All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner..."
6952,Mmmm... re-circulated air.
6953,"What, Flanders."
6954,"Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"""
6955,"Well, Moe, this is it. Today's the day I get my new air conditioner."
6956,She has a gift.
6957,Oooh.
6958,Wowww...
6959,A musical instrument? Could that be a way to encourage a gifted child? Just give me a sign!
6960,"Eh, works for me."
6961,"So what do you like, Lisa? Viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe?"
6962,Ohh! Saxomophone.
6963,Two hundred dollars!
6964,"Oh, I'll take it."
6965,"Yeah. ""To Lisa. Never forget your Daddy loves ."""
6966,...and that inscription is still there today.
6967,"Next, I'll tell you the origin of Maggie's pacifier."
6968,"Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?"
6969,Will you get off my front lawn?
6970,"Why -- oh, I give up."
6971,I learned from the master.
6972,Lisa! Enough saxomophone already!
6973,Stupid hippo.
6974,Stupid frog.
6975,"Relax, I built a bomb shelter."
6976,"Fine, then don't use it."
6977,Good.
6978,So do I.
6979,You should be.
6980,"Blankets, radio... Oh, a Gary Larson calendar. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I--don't get it."
6981,You call that prime rib?
6982,"It's green, moron. Earth to stupid guy, hullo? Maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass."
6983,"Heh, still got it..."
6984,"Geez, what's with all the death?"
6985,Oh my God. Everyone's gone! Little Bart...
6986,Little Lisa-a-a...
6987,Little Marge...
6988,And the rest.
6989,"Oh, I've lost everything. I can't go on. No, no, no! I can't just wallow in sadness. It's time to laugh again. I'm the last man alive!"
6990,And I can do everything I've always wanted!
6991,"Oh Spade, why did you put Farley in charge of the bees? Hey buddy, down in front."
6992,War! Hunh! Good God y'all! / What is it good for? / Absolutely nothin'! Say it again! Okay!
6993,"Hey, what happened to the tunes?"
6994,"Hey, what the hell's goin' on? Where'd you get those cloaks?"
6995,You're mutants?
6996,You want me? Come and get me!!
6997,A c... a coffin!
6998,"Die, you chalk-faced goons!"
6999,"Go to hell, cloaky!"
7000,Safe at last.
7001,That better not be the mutants.
7002,Marge! Kids! You're alive!
7003,"Ohh, com'ere."
7004,Now that's the Marge I married.
7005,"So, who wants to steal some Ferraris?"
7006,"Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone."
7007,He's crazy.
7008,"Hmmm, two bucks... And it only transports matter? Umm... Well, ah... I'll give you 35 cents."
7009,I said I'll take it.
7010,"This mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. But not any more, baby!"
7011,"Good night, losers!"
7012,"Man, how'd I live without this thing?"
7013,"Oh, man that's good."
7014,"Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. If you don't use it responsibly... Kablamo!"
7015,It was your mother.
7016,"Bart, are you in there? Have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?"
7017,I think she's right. The pants are a dead giveaway.
7018,"So then Lenny says, ""As if! Don't even go there, sister."""
7019,"Yeah, well Lenny said it."
7020,"Eh, it'll turn up somewhere."
7021,"Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart."
7022,"Get 'im, boy! Smash that fly! Mush him up good!"
7023,"Nice work, son."
7024,"Nobody likes a tattletale, honey."
7025,"Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with."
7026,Something I should have done a long time ago.
7027,I'll teach you to mess with my machine!
7028,I'm gonna chop you good!
7029,That cost me 35 cents!
7030,You're just making it worse. I promise I won't hurt you.
7031,"That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa."
7032,Woo hoo! I accuse Goody Flanders.
7033,They're in my hair! They're in my hair!
7034,"C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you're not home!"
7035,She's a witch!
7036,I don't know.
7037,"Oh, I've never heard of those people."
7038,Woo hoo!
7039,"Yes, yes, oh God yes!"
7040,"Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win."
7041,Bo-ring!
7042,"Oh, but I want to do some rioting."
7043,All done.
7044,"I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please."
7045,"Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know."
7046,"Watch the fish, Marge."
7047,"What did I tell you, Marge?"
7048,"Oh, let's get that."
7049,Let's get that! The suffocation thing!
7050,Five hundred dollars! Forget it.
7051,"I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are."
7052,"I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have."
7053,"I don't have to be careful, I got a gun."
7054,"Oh, yeah."
7055,Baby.
7056,Mmm-hmm.
7057,Ahh.
7058,"Ooo, I like the sound of that."
7059,"Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Just gimme my gun."
7060,Five days! But I'm mad now!
7061,I'd kill you if I had my gun.
7062,Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
7063,"Well, if he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two."
7064,Let's see what happens when he walks into my store. Then we'll see who's worried about five day waiting period...
7065,Marge kicked me out.
7066,"Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children."
7067,How am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?
7068,"Come on, come on, open up!"
7069,"Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me."
7070,Yuh.
7071,Yeah.
7072,Former President.
7073,Potentially dangerous?
7074,Woo hoo!
7075,"Close your eyes Marge, I've got a surprise for you."
7076,Okay. Open your eyes!
7077,"Hey, it's a handgun! Isn't it great? This is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die..."
7078,I thought Smithers did it.
7079,Only if you clean your room.
7080,TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution.
7081,"You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you?"
7082,"All right, then."
7083,"A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what: you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more."
7084,Pull!
7085,"Learnin' somethin', Marge?"
7086,"Hi, I'm Homer S."
7087,"Hi. It seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!"
7088,"Oh, come on, be fair Marge. For once in your life, be fair."
7089,Sorry.
7090,"What? Oh Apu, I would never..."
7091,Or would I?
7092,I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.
7093,"All right, put your... Oh well, I'll rob it next time."
7094,"Sure thing, honey."
7095,You want me to get the cat down?
7096,"See you in hell, dinner plate."
7097,"Mmm, you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get-together?"
7098,You said the breakfast table.
7099,"Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on."
7100,"Oops, guess it already was on."
7101,Uh. I'd better just put it down.
7102,"All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you."
7103,And I'm a wonderful man.
7104,"Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun."
7105,"I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?"
7106,"But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!"
7107,So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!
7108,Do you know how to cook dinner?
7109,"Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!"
7110,They're here! They're here!
7111,"Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
7112,Anyone else want a beer?
7113,I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
7114,"Yeah, but..."
7115,I didn't get one yet.
7116,"This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun."
7117,This stinks. I want my family back.
7118,"Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?"
7119,Sorry.
7120,"Oh, Marge, there's so many things I want to yell to you!"
7121,O-kay!
7122,"Oh-ho, confused, would we?"
7123,"Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome. And there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks."
7124,"It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?"
7125,"Freeze, bad guy!"
7126,"I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was..."
7127,"The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing."
7128,"Okay, don't shoot!"
7129,"I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!"
7130,Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
7131,You're a disgrace to this family.
7132,"There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches."
7133,Then it's settled.
7134,"Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this team has ever had."
7135,"Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot."
7136,"Fun, too."
7137,"Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!"
7138,"Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times."
7139,"Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
7140,"Yes, Roy."
7141,"Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?"
7142,"Yeah, Homer again. I think we got cut off. Y'ello?"
7143,Flaaaan-ders... Flaaaan-ders...
7144,Flaaaan-ders...
7145,Game's out there! Made you look...
7146,"I know, Sweetie, and I got him right in the... uh-oh."
7147,"Hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, Flanders. Go Wildcats!"
7148,"No, no. No, no, no. It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you."
7149,Me? But you were doing such a great job.
7150,You're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.
7151,Then why are you running the obstacle course?
7152,You never use it.
7153,Wipe that smile off your face.
7154,"I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps."
7155,Do it.
7156,"Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it."
7157,"I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?"
7158,My father never believed in me.
7159,"Well, I'm not gonna make the same mistake. From now on I'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my Dad."
7160,"Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!"
7161,I believe in you! Hug meeeee!
7162,Will you hug meeeee? Hug meee!
7163,"Good practice, team. Okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts."
7164,"Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you."
7165,"Congratulations, the rest of you made the team."
7166,"Except you, you and you."
7167,"Now just because I'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. He calls me ""Coach"" just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!"
7168,"What is it, sweetie?"
7169,"Not any more. From now on, you're my main man. Okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. Oh, Rod, you don't have to. You're cut."
7170,"Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you."
7171,Since your mother yelled at me. Now how 'bout that hug?
7172,"Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, Flanders?"
7173,"It's okay, son. You'll do better next time."
7174,Look at him go!
7175,"Exx-cellent poise, son. You panicked, but you didn't lose your cool."
7176,"Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters."
7177,"Oh, really? Do reeky players get the game ball?"
7178,"Hey, everybody! Let's hear it for Bart!"
7179,"Ah, you guys are some k..."
7180,"Ohh, your Mother's not pregnant, is she?"
7181,"Ohh, boy. Well, I'll just have to go to my back up plan... Nelson, how's your arm feelin'?"
7182,"Good, take this note over to the referee."
7183,"Come on, guys. We can't play without Bart. He's the heart of this team!"
7184,"Don't listen to them, son. I have total faith in you."
7185,"What? Well, I got news for you, Mister. You can't quit! You're cut! You too, Milhouse."
7186,"Oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too."
7187,"I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge. It must have been you. You've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler..."
7188,"Well, if quitting is the best, maybe I should just quit my job."
7189,"Mr. Burns, this is Homer J. Simpson, the father of the big quitter. Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big quitter, too, and I quit!"
7190,So...
7191,"We're in the championship. Way to go, team!"
7192,"Well, Bart, looks like it's just you and... Ohhh."
7193,"I'm feelin' kinda low, Apu. You got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? You know, ""Skittlebrau""?"
7194,"Oh. Well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of Skittles."
7195,"Hello, son."
7196,"I wanna apologize. I just got so caught up trying to encourage you, I was blinded to your stinky performance. If you forgive me, I promise I'll never encourage you again."
7197,I've got lots of quarters.
7198,"Aww... You know, tomorrow's the championship game and I could sure use a good offensive tackle."
7199,Consider him cut.
7200,"Hold on, I'm workin' it out."
7201,"Okay. Half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, Nelson, you just spin around in a circle."
7202,"Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?"
7203,"Are you sure, son?"
7204,I knew I could count on you.
7205,"Scully, you're cut. Ehhh, Brooks, Groening, Simon, you're all cut. Castellaneta, gone. Kavner, cut. Cartwright, cut. Smith, sorry, cut. Azaria and Shearer, you're cut. Firestone, you're cut. So is Judge. Namath, you stay. All of those people are cut. Phil, Schultz and Wolf and Silverman. Goldreyer, O'Brien, Dolye, Selman. I don't know what... I don't know what you're doin' here, 'cause you're all cut. Pietila, Clan..., Kuwahaha... There're so many cuts here look, I'll just post 'em up and you just see where your name is. Oooo, look at how many cuts there are there. Ohhh, boy, you're cut. All of you. He's cut, I cut you! You're cut too, Shooshie!"
7206,"Yeah, why don't we buy 'em mink stoles while we're at it?"
7207,I understand. Yoink. Wow...
7208,Whoa...
7209,"Ooo, let's see what she wrote!"
7210,"Oh, you hate lotus flowers, too? Oh, don't get me started on Lotus flowers."
7211,"Oh. Well, congratulations."
7212,Not... really...
7213,"O-kay, here we go..."
7214,Tell her the truth. You're not ready to get married.
7215,Then just tell her you're already married.
7216,Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!
7217,Loser. Loser. Loser. Five... hundred.... dollars! Apu wake up! I want to buy a Yodel and this lottery ticket.
7218,I have this much.
7219,Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.
7220,"Late night, huh?"
7221,You dog.
7222,What's the big problem?
7223,Then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
7224,"Okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um..."
7225,"Wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that Marge is your wife."
7226,It's you.
7227,"Oh, that Yodel was so good. I wish I was eatin' it right now."
7228,"Oh, crap, I forgot!"
7229,"Marge, I need a small favor. For the next few days, will you pretend to be Apu's wife?"
7230,Please? It's just for as long as his mother's living here.
7231,Can you feel the love?
7232,"Okay, gotta run. Apu, I'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before Marge yells at you again."
7233,But you can't leave! We're scammin' an old lady at my house and I need a place to hide out.
7234,"Oh, right. With the giant heads."
7235,"Hey, Dad. I've come to spend some time with my favorite father."
7236,You're already in a home.
7237,"Oh, no, I'm not... Oh, well, let's see whatcha got here."
7238,"Supper at 4 o'clock? Oh-ho, what a sweet deal!"
7239,"Hey! They got chairs with wheels, and here I am using my legs like a sucker!"
7240,"Jasper. Gladys. Beatrice. Lookin' good, Hattie. Asa. Hazel. Hazel! Hazel!"
7241,"Oh, the hell with her. Hester. Emil. Prudence. Lemuel. Increase. Dad."
7242,"Oh, no you don't."
7243,Eat my dust!
7244,Damn right.
7245,Mmm. Who knew that Lay's made liquid potato chips? I can't suck just one.
7246,"Please. Also, I think I'm getting a bedsore. What do you have to do to get turned around here?"
7247,"Hey, what's Lucky hooked up to?"
7248,And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker! And how come everyone gets a bedpan and I have to walk all the way over there?
7249,Yeah!
7250,"When I get old, Marge, I want you to promise you'll put me in a home. It's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
7251,"Ohhh, right, right. The fake marriage thing. How's that goin'?"
7252,Lied to his mother.
7253,"You know what you could do, Apu..."
7254,You could fake your own death...
7255,All you need is a car bomb and...
7256,"Moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?"
7257,"Actually, it's more like twelve. No, I'm so stupid, seven. It's seven hours. You have seven hours. See? Seven."
7258,C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
7259,You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.
7260,"Ahh. Is this the life, or what?"
7261,"Nah, just your screwy country."
7262,"Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love."
7263,"Gods, eh?"
7264,Screw him.
7265,Put me down! Ganesh commands you! Oh-ho-ho-ho!
7266,"Come on, elephant. Put me down! Hey, everyone seems upside down."
7267,"""Up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt..."" Da-da-da-da-da."
7268,That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.
7269,Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.
7270,"I'd like a yellow boat, please. With extra motors."
7271,Woo hoo!
7272,"Howdy, gents! I'm here to collect my free--"
7273,OW! OW! My boating arm! What's going on?
7274,"Lousy cops. Lucky for you I'm double-parked or I'd... There. Now, can I please have my motorboat?"
7275,I didn't like it. The mast had termites.
7276,Because... the thingee was... shut up.
7277,Fossils shmossils. You can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. Bones shmones.
7278,Lemme through! I got here late!
7279,Now that's interesting.
7280,"So long, suckers!"
7281,"Come on... Come on, Angel."
7282,I'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
7283,I'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
7284,"Pfft. That's what they said about this Billy Beer, smartypants."
7285,Ahh. We elected the wrong Carter.
7286,Sounds like goood watchin'.
7287,"Get your own angel, ya moocher."
7288,"Hey, I'm trying to eat here. Beat it, Pegleg!"
7289,"A buck, eh? That gives me an idea..."
7290,"Fifty cents, please."
7291,HEEERE'S THE ANGEL! / SEEEE THE ANGEL / IT'S MY ANGEL / NO ONE ELSE'S / NEXT TO-OO TH-E RAKES!
7292,"No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word ""angel""."
7293,That's a typo.
7294,"Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose out on bags and bags of money. It's sacrilegious, I tell ya."
7295,Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.
7296,"Okay, folks. Get your angel glow sticks! No one gets into heaven without a glow stick!"
7297,Somebody stop her!
7298,"Oh-ho, no! This can't be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?"
7299,You damn well better!
7300,"Okay, okay, don't panic. Marge, stop panicking. We need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. Bart! Strip down to your skeleton!"
7301,Look! A message!
7302,"""The end will come at sundown."" Heh heh heh heh. Hey, wait a second. I don't like the sound of that."
7303,"Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan."
7304,"Oh, Marge, don't let go, no matter what. If they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too."
7305,"Ahh, I love these lazy Saturdays."
7306,Work!
7307,"Ahh, I love these real Saturdays. They're so relaxing. Not like that fake Saturday that almost got me fired."
7308,Absolutely.
7309,It is?
7310,We do?
7311,"Oh, that."
7312,Ah.
7313,Pfft. Friends of the library?
7314,I went yesterday.
7315,Lenny really wanted to go.
7316,Open a window.
7317,"Allll right, I hear ya, honey. Change into something nice. We're steppin' out!"
7318,Can you believe it? It's already been a year.
7319,"Wow, sweetheart. Look at all this seized booty. We could find the drug boat of our dreams!"
7320,"Well, I bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!"
7321,Woo hoo!
7322,I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.
7323,Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm-hm-hm.
7324,"Oh, yeah. You've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this...."
7325,You're the boss.
7326,Okay-bye-love-you.
7327,"Oh, yeah. I'm a real expert."
7328,You betcha.
7329,Nothin' but.
7330,Oh yeah.
7331,I see.
7332,"I don't know, Marge. Trying is the first step toward failure."
7333,You're all nuts.
7334,What about me? You didn't thank me.
7335,I like being thanked.
7336,Seat belts?! Pfft! They kill more people than they save.
7337,"Gee, that picture makes your butt look big."
7338,Lumber. We need lumber.
7339,"Hey, Skinner! Wanna drag race?"
7340,Come on! It'll be fun!
7341,Come on... you... stupid... car... you... get... goin'...
7342,Lousy doormat.
7343,"Yeah, honey. Even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother."
7344,"Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her clear the table in peace?"
7345,"Man, the air feels good on my neck!"
7346,"Ooo, gumball."
7347,"Wow, honey, you sold a house and got rid of the Flanders. What's for dinner?"
7348,"Yeah, me too. Let me know if you need any help."
7349,It was just an expression.
7350,That old Flanders place gives me the creeps.
7351,"""MY NAME IS LUKA, / I LIVE ON THE SECOND FLOOR..."""
7352,"This is my car! And I'm not fat, it's glandular!"
7353,Stop it!
7354,You're...
7355,...going...
7356,...down...
7357,...punk!
7358,"Yeah, you're right."
7359,"Oh. Oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap."
7360,"Oh, you will, honey. You will."
7361,Stupid heater! Don't make me come in there!
7362,"You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle."
7363,"Oh, Santa's got a little trick up his sleeve."
7364,"Attention, shoppers. Register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience."
7365,"Sorry, these are for display only... This has been recalled... Oo, Bart would like this... We're out of these..."
7366,Register 9 is now closed.
7367,"C'mon, kids. Let's try the lights!"
7368,Knock it off...
7369,"What the-- Where's Christmas? Lisa, where's Christmas?"
7370,Can - we - skip - church?
7371,"Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: God hates us."
7372,"Okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy."
7373,"Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis."
7374,That's not as fun as it looks.
7375,"Lisa, you promised they'd be miserable. What the hell's goin' on?!"
7376,"Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe."
7377,"You take that back, Barney!"
7378,"Stay out of this, old man."
7379,"Aw, that's my girl. I love you, Marjorie."
7380,You shut up.
7381,"Oh, Marge, I don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish."
7382,"Wow, this really restores your faith in..."
7383,"Lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!"
7384,"Thanks, Ted."
7385,"Marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!"
7386,"Is this car $15,000?"
7387,What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it.
7388,"Outta my way, snow-poke!"
7389,"Don't worry, honey. I know exactly what I'm --"
7390,Oopsie.
7391,Shut up! One at a time! Lisa?
7392,I knew this would happen.
7393,"Lisa, no! Your hands are too weak!"
7394,"I'm gonna kill you! / No, I'm killing him first! / Why you little... Bart, the next time you ever have... / You went too far..."
7395,"Yes, Kent. ""Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist."""
7396,"Oh, it's true! We weren't robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true!"
7397,"Well, the boy told us. But that was after we filed a phony police report."
7398,"Relax, Marge. This'll all blow over."
7399,"Oh, no. Look at the line!"
7400,Head of the line! A family could get used to being shunned. Huh? Huh?
7401,"Run for your lives, everyone! This is not a drill!"
7402,"Oh great, now we have to send him a card."
7403,There's only one way out. We've gotta give this greedy town its money back.
7404,"Oh no, there's that angry mob again."
7405,What the hell's goin' on?
7406,Maybe so. But there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. This washcloth.
7407,The hell it is!
7408,"Gimme that! / Uh, gimme that! / No! / Let go! / Gimme that my washcloth! / I want it!"
7409,"Hey, she's getting away with the washcloth!"
7410,Go!
7411,"Oh, I got it! Oh, it's just a thread! It was... She's got... she's got the washcloth!"
7412,"Well, they put us on the ""Waiting to Exhale Waiting List."" But they said don't hold your breath."
7413,"Whoa. Whoa. Calm down, little lady--Take it easy--Take it easy. No."
7414,"Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot 'em up western!"
7415,"With blood, I bet!"
7416,"They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing each other?"
7417,"Wait, wait, wait. Here comes Lee Marvin. Thank God. He's always drunk and violent."
7418,Bart!
7419,"Ooh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing?"
7420,Singing is the lowest form of communication.
7421,"No I don't, I hate to rhyme."
7422,"NO I DON'T, I THINK THEY'RE BAD / THEY'RE FAKE AND PHONEY AND TOTALLY WRONG."
7423,I WOULDN'T / I COULDN'T / I HATE THAT STUFF!
7424,AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA.
7425,"SEE? ALL THIS SINGING SCARED HIM AWAY / IF WE JUST TALKED LIKE NORMAL, HE'D PROBABLY STAY."
7426,Okay.
7427,I knew I should've shut that window.
7428,EVEN THE CRIMINALS ARE BEGINNING TO CROON.
7429,"ALL RIGHT MARGE, YOU'VE CONVINCED ME, THERE ARE MORE TERRIBLE THINGS / THAN MUSICAL COMEDIES WHERE EVERYONE SINGS."
7430,And not a moment too soon.
7431,"The experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how."
7432,"Sor-reee, your majesty."
7433,Ice-cream-man-Ice cream-man!
7434,It's carnival time!
7435,"Here's money, kids! Take what you need!"
7436,Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!
7437,Oo! Oo! I want to see Lobster Boy and Shrimp Girl!
7438,Oo! Oo! Me first!
7439,Heart condition? Get outta here.
7440,"Obviously, I don't. Now if you'll get out of my way..."
7441,"He's not just some ""guy,"" Marge. He's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. Carnies built this country. The carnival part of it, anyway. And though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men."
7442,"Yes, sir!"
7443,"Ow, my heart!"
7444,Do do do do do...
7445,"Who, me?"
7446,"Sorry, son. Daddy failed."
7447,A novelty comb! Kings among men...
7448,"Hey, come on! He doesn't have any money. Look at his clothes."
7449,"Hey, that's not fair! I wanna be a carny, too! Can I, mister? Huh? Can I? Please?"
7450,"Sure, anything you want."
7451,"Oh-ho, put down your stick. We're here to work."
7452,Hmm...
7453,"Yeah, he's telling the truth."
7454,"Thanks for the food, Mister..."
7455,"Did ya hear that, Bart? The Carny Code. Bart, did you hear that?"
7456,"Yes, sir!"
7457,Fry up some cheese?
7458,"Please, folks. Hold your fire. The water level is dangerously low. Oh!"
7459,Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ow! My leg!
7460,Oh. Bart?
7461,Do I like chicken?
7462,I guess not.
7463,"Buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world."
7464,"Oh, we'll see about that. Gimme ten rings."
7465,"Ah, yes. How do we handle refunds?"
7466,Gimme ten rings.
7467,"Hey, there's a sucker."
7468,"Yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems."
7469,And how...
7470,I understand.
7471,"Not right now, son. Daddy's talking to a policeman."
7472,No. He's Bart.
7473,Okay.
7474,It's a ring toss game.
7475,"Well, ain't that somethin'."
7476,"I was trying to, but the opportunity never came up."
7477,Can't you stay in the Whack-A-Mole game?
7478,"Look at 'em, Bart. If a carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to anyone."
7479,"Yes, but first there's a little matter of the Carny Code."
7480,"Cooder, Spud. Get off that hog. You're coming to stay at our house."
7481,"Oh, it won't be long. Once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. The older one can pull out his left eye."
7482,"Now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh Marge?"
7483,That's weird. The key doesn't fit.
7484,Cooder! What have you done to our house?
7485,You can't do this to me. What about the Carny Code?
7486,Carnies took over our house. You've gotta help us.
7487,Thank you so much.
7488,"Honey, Daddy's waiting for the detective."
7489,"Listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... You better not be in my ass-groove!"
7490,It took me years to forge that groove.
7491,Good Morning everybody.
7492,Stupid Gravity.
7493,I've got it!
7494,"Aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. They're the cleverest folk in the world. Just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. That's it! Fire! Or..."
7495,"I've got a proposition for you, Cooder."
7496,"One game of ring toss. If I can throw this Hula Hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. If I miss, I'll sign the deed over to you."
7497,That's right.
7498,Now!
7499,"Yeah, I guess your old man is smarter than you thought."
7500,"Look at 'em standing out there. No place to go. Heh, heh. Poor guys. Hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days?"
7501,My groove!
7502,They mushed it all out of shape.
7503,"All right, better put on a pot of coffee, Marge. This could take a while."
7504,"Come on now, just a little more. Little more to the left... to the left there. What did he do this thing? Almost... Ahhhhhhhhh"
7505,"I always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school."
7506,"This, Bart, is a crazy man."
7507,Right. That'll work.
7508,Hmm. Makes sense.
7509,How much is this free resort weekend?
7510,And when is this weekend?
7511,Uh huh. And how much does it cost?
7512,I see. And when is it?
7513,And what are you charging for this free weekend?
7514,"It's free, right?"
7515,"Who cares what it is? The point is these are some decent, generous people that I can take advantage of."
7516,"Marge, Marge, Marge. Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?"
7517,"So, I beat the system."
7518,Yes. I am the highly suggestible type.
7519,"Outta my way, jerk ass!"
7520,"NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA FISH-ING / FISH-ING, FISH-ING--"
7521,Fish-ing.
7522,Who the hell is that? Some kind of leader?
7523,Will there be beer?
7524,Homer no function beer well without.
7525,What kind of beer?
7526,Really? I'm surprised about Maggie.
7527,"Wow, a free movie. Thanks! Outta my way, jerk ass."
7528,"Whoa, you've got my number on that one, buddy! This is a smart group."
7529,"Now wait a minute, Moe --"
7530,Wait - I'm confused about the movie. So the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?
7531,"Well, you see, when I get bored, I make up my own movie. I have a very short attention span."
7532,"Ooh, look a bird."
7533,"Uh yeah, I guess I could lose a few pounds. And I can be kind of thick sometimes."
7534,"Oh, my mistake."
7535,"You gonna finish that, bony?"
7536,"NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / LEA-DER, LEA-DER, LEA-DER!"
7537,"BATMAN! / I MEAN, LEADER! I LOVE THE LEADER!"
7538,ACT II
7539,"Come again, Marge?"
7540,I've joined the Movementarians! And so have all of you!
7541,"All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor."
7542,"Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family."
7543,I have not been brainwashed. Kill the girl. Kill the girl.
7544,What? What did I say?
7545,Of course not! Except that we're all moving to the Movementarian Agricultural Compound to be near the Leader and serve him.
7546,And it didn't cost us a dime.
7547,"Hah, why even unpack?"
7548,"That's a negatory, good buddy!"
7549,"See, Marge? Our lives are so much better now!"
7550,Oh boy! We get to see the Leader pass by.
7551,"Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American, but what are ya gonna do?"
7552,I've never been so happy.
7553,"But Marge, we're not mass married."
7554,These lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast and lunch. Oh! A lima bean that looks just like the Leader! I'll put it with the others.
7555,What an honor! We've been called into the presence of --
7556,Marge? You're the Leader? You don't look anything like the beans.
7557,The Leader knows all and sees all.
7558,And he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
7559,Beer?
7560,Go ahead! Give in! Beer! Beer!
7561,"Ooh, these cotton-poly blends are sooo comfortable!"
7562,But I want to go.
7563,"I'm glad I'm back! Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, I was born again!"
7564,Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize. The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! He's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
7565,Whoops.
7566,To think I turned to a cult for mindless happiness when I had beer all along.
7567,"And you Marge, the bringer of beer!"
7568,Yeah. He's my favorite fictional character.
7569,Woo hoo!
7570,Quiet. God looks like he has something important to say.
7571,"I can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers. I have Smallpox... Well, it wasn't wiped out in my house."
7572,"Water bill, third notice... jury duty, third notice... mortgage bill, ooh, second notice..."
7573,Flancrest Enterprises?
7574,You liar. You don't have a home business. Why would you make up a lie like that?
7575,"Internet, eh?"
7576,"Scratch, eh?"
7577,"Maude, eh?"
7578,"No time to answer that, Marge. I'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise."
7579,Ever heard of a little thing called the Internet?
7580,"Oh yeah, everybody's making money off the Internet except us. We've fallen behind. Way behind."
7581,"Can't discuss that now, Marge. I have to write another delicious memo."
7582,Mmm... memo.
7583,"What am I gonna call my Internet company? All the good names are taken. Oh, wait, I've got it! Flancrest Enterprises."
7584,"Uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting edge, like Cutco... or Edgecom... Interslice... Come on, Marge -- you're good at these. Help me out."
7585,"Fine. It's not important. What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself Vice President. No, wait... Junior Vice President."
7586,CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet. Junior Vice President Homer Simpson speaking. How may I direct your call?
7587,It's Patty.
7588,"Welcome to the Internet, my friend. How can I help you?"
7589,Can I have some money now?
7590,"Ooo, they have the Internet on computers now..."
7591,"Bill Gates? Billionaire computer nerd Bill Gates? Oh my God, oh my God! Get out of sight, Marge! I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation!"
7592,You don't look so rich.
7593,"Get a load of the bowl job, Marge."
7594,"This is it, Marge. I poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! We're rich! Richer than astronauts!"
7595,"Oh, right. I reluctantly accept your proposal."
7596,"Hey, what the hell's going on?!"
7597,"Well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him."
7598,"Well, well, well... If it isn't Professor Know-it-all. 'Scuse me, Marge."
7599,"That's where you're wrong, pal!"
7600,It's not enough to want a cracker. You have to earn it!
7601,"Why, yes. Yes I do."
7602,A rest home for pirates?
7603,Now that's a fight I wanna be a part of.
7604,I don't get it.
7605,I still don't get it.
7606,Oh I get it. I get jokes.
7607,"Yes! Yes! Oh, God yes!"
7608,"Take that, Marge!"
7609,"Woop, sorry son. I didn't know you, Jay Leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown."
7610,Oooh! Oh! Krusty!
7611,Booo!
7612,I also have to go. Booo!
7613,Krusty's gone nuts...
7614,"I'll cover ya, honey."
7615,Woo! TV! Yeah!
7616,Impeach Churchill!
7617,"Take that, you greedy fat cats. Marge, gimme your purse."
7618,"From now on, I'm gonna be just like Krusty and tell it like it is. Marge, you're gettin' a little fat around the old thighs."
7619,"You too, Bart."
7620,"You didn't have to tell it like it is, Marge."
7621,I hope he tells us to burn our pants. These things are drivin' me nuts!
7622,Don't you hate pants?
7623,"Hey, I thought your mother told you to take a bath."
7624,"Aw, I understand, kids. I'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man."
7625,Don't worry. Daddy'll fix it.
7626,Hmmm.
7627,Outta my way! She's gonna blow!
7628,Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.
7629,To Marge. And all the blissful years I've spent hiding from her in this bar.
7630,Whatever happened to your mail order bride?
7631,So her career got in the way.
7632,"Now, now, I won't hear of it, Moe. You're a fabulous catch."
7633,He thought he was gonna steal--
7634,"Oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. But that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. Come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town."
7635,Relax. All I smell is garlic and fish.
7636,"Okay, I won't lie to you. A lot of people saw that. But you gotta keep tryin'."
7637,"Hey, don't give up, Moe. The girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar."
7638,"Let's get out of here, Moe. This is goin' nowhere."
7639,Stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
7640,Maa-rrge...
7641,"Oh, yeah, I got that."
7642,"Aw, come on, Moe. Think of all you have to offer besides money."
7643,"If you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car."
7644,"Steal? Oh no, you got the wrong guy."
7645,You dropped somethin'.
7646,"Oh, you did. But -- I still don't know... I can just imagine what Marge would say."
7647,I'll do it!
7648,Mmmm... me.
7649,What about the cops?
7650,"So, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?"
7651,"You're a genius, Moe. All your troubles will soon be over for a couple months."
7652,Why all the pearls? Why all the hair? Why anything?
7653,"No, you look a little nervous, Lisa."
7654,No. I'm just going out to commit certain deeds.
7655,Suckers.
7656,I'm gonna be the best car thief ever.
7657,"Hey! Oh, no you don't!"
7658,"""Stealing, stealing / Stealing a car for Moe / Dada dada dada dada / Insurance fraud today..."""
7659,"They're showing ""Hail to the Chimp!"" Oh, I have time to see one little movie!"
7660,That's what you get for not hailing to the Chimp.
7661,"Oh, no! The train!"
7662,I gotta find another way to wreck Moe's car!
7663,"Homer, you genius."
7664,Ger-onimo!
7665,Huh?
7666,Whoa! Hang on a minute! The guard said I have visitors coming!
7667,"Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Great! Listen, I know it looks bad. But all I can tell you is I destroyed that car for all the right reasons."
7668,"That's my girl. You just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. Moe will take care of everything."
7669,"Aw, thanks, boy. I'll give you two packs for that candy bar."
7670,Why you little...
7671,"Moe! Oh, Moe, thank God you're here!"
7672,But I'm in jail.
7673,"Moe, you gotta get me outta here. Tell the cops I didn't steal the car. Say you lent it to me."
7674,"But Moe, we're best friends..."
7675,"Hurry, Moe. At three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. The exercise yard!"
7676,"Hurry up, Moe, for the love of God! Hurry up!"
7677,Hawaii? What about Hawaii? Moe? Who's going to Hawaii? Am I going to Hawaii?
7678,"Let me out! I'm innocent! I changed my mind, I don't want to be in here anymore!"
7679,Going somewhere?
7680,Hmm... This could be useful...
7681,Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee! Must kill Moe. Wheeeeee!
7682,You!
7683,"Oh-ho, I'll help you. Help you die!"
7684,"I... also sleep... G'night, Mommy..."
7685,"Ohh, I could never stay mad at you, Moe. After all, you get me drunk."
7686,"Aw, Moe, Moe, Moe, dry those beady little eyes. Your buddy Homer'll get you back on your feet."
7687,Woo hoo!
7688,"Um, I'm looking for something in an after-dinner burrito."
7689,"Oh, forget it!"
7690,"Well, why would I want to look at a pen with a... Oh no, her clothes are coming off! Heh, heh. Hey, you know who would love this? Men."
7691,"Five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!"
7692,"Hey, hey look, a freezer man!"
7693,I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
7694,"Now you're swingin', honey!"
7695,That makes 22 to 16.
7696,Room for one more...
7697,"Hey, yeah."
7698,Bo-ring!
7699,"Boy, seeing that stomach surgery made me hungry! Marge, we need five thousand CC's of snacks, stat!"
7700,"C'mon, Lisa, join the family!"
7701,"What way, angel pie?"
7702,"Fine, she doesn't get her skin!"
7703,"If I were her, I'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake."
7704,Moochin' war widows...
7705,That's a good idea. Let's go out for some frosty swirls.
7706,We'll tape it!
7707,"Pff... ""Simpson gene!"" Somebody's got to set that girl straight. And I know how to do it."
7708,"Marge, get me your address book, four beers, and my conversation hat."
7709,"Lisa, it's me, Daddy, your father. I rounded up every Simpson in the tri-city area, so I can prove to you there's nothing wrong with the Simpson genes. This is your Great-Uncle Chet. Go ahead, Chet, tell her what you do."
7710,"Oh. But... you run it, right?"
7711,"Okay. Uh, this is your second cousin Stanley."
7712,Everybody hates birds! ...Right!
7713,"Well uh, you look pretty successful."
7714,What about you?
7715,"Oh, Lisa's right. We're nothing but a big bunch of losers. Show's over, folks. Go home."
7716,You get it after you leave. Now get out of here.
7717,"Fine, fine. What do you do... ""Dr. Simpson""?"
7718,"Oh well, thanks, honey. Remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a Simpson and a success."
7719,"Yes, son. A spectacular failure."
7720,"Yeah. Good things don't end with ""eum."" They end with ""mania""... Or ""teria."" Will there be beer?"
7721,What'd he say? What about my car?
7722,I'm gonna try the sex education computer!
7723,"Ovulate, damn you! Ovulate!"
7724,"Then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. But we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. Oh yeah, and my other friend was already there."
7725,"Woo hoo! Beer, beer, beer!"
7726,Uh-oh.
7727,"""Hi, this is Jerry Maguire. Show me the message. Show me the message."""
7728,"""Do the message! Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."""

7730,"You're the man, Ralph!"
7731,"Uh, Maybe."
7732,"Yep, I earned it."
7733,"Mmmm, donuts."
7734,"Gentlemen, there's only one solution. We place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big."
7735,Success!
7736,It's my first day.
7737,It's my first day.
7738,Fired. I can't believe it.
7739,"Ooh, funky."
7740,I've joined the naval reserve.
7741,"You know Lisa, I've taken a lot from this country. Maybe it's time I gave something back."
7742,Would you be proud of me?
7743,Then I'll do it!
7744,There's a question that's crossed out.
7745,"Well, I think I can make it out. ""Are you a homosex..."""
7746,But I'm not a h--
7747,Nice fella. I wonder if he's gay?
7748,"Not to worry, honey. We live in a highly technological age, where fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light."
7749,"Sorry, can't hear you, Marge. I'm clapping."
7750,Nighty-night!
7751,"Well, guys, I won't be seeing you for a while."
7752,"Gee, thanks guys. This is just like ""The Deer Hunter."""
7753,See ya in a week.
7754,"Aw, that's sweet, honey. I'll bring you back a hat."
7755,No.
7756,"Oh, he did, did he? I'll show him! I'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!"
7757,But only if you're good. Even if you're not.
7758,"No way, man! My hair is who I am!"
7759,I'm a freak!
7760,What the--?
7761,"Uh, a seagull took my sailor hat."
7762,I like you.
7763,Maybe you would like me if you got to know me.
7764,"Well, I'm no Margaret Cho, but I do a pretty fair Columbo impression. Ah, one more thing - One- I should get a glass of water."
7765,There! The perfect sheepshank.
7766,Ulll.....
7767,Request permission to come aboard.
7768,Marge!
7769,"You know Marge, joining the reserves was the best thing I ever did. I feel good about myself, I'm helping my country, and later, I'm gonna get Gilligan's autograph."
7770,Then I'll whomp him with my hat.
7771,Bart!
7772,"Get back here, boy!"
7773,You're a disgrace to this family and its proud Naval tradition!
7774,I always thought Lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
7775,No!
7776,Nu-cue-lar. It's pronounced NU-cue-lar.
7777,"Oh, Lisa, it's just war games. It's not like a game could hurt me."
7778,"Damn you, rock'em sock'em robots! Can't we all just get along?"
7779,We have orders not to fire on anybody but Greenpeace.
7780,"Well, I guess that's everyone. Except earring-boy."
7781,"Well, when I was ten I got my ear pierced but this is completely different!"
7782,"Uh, is the poopdeck really what I think it is?"
7783,What's a jib?
7784,Thank you.
7785,I want peas.
7786,Uh-huh.
7787,With a knife.
7788,And you're like the father I never visit.
7789,Me?
7790,"Ooh, comfy."
7791,I'unno.
7792,Hmm. What would the Captain say in my spot?
7793,Fire the torpedoes!
7794,"All right, all right, mellow out, everybody. The Captain'll know what to do."
7795,I am?
7796,Very well then. I'm a Captain.
7797,Mr. Moe -- steady as she goes!
7798,"Damage report, Mr. Moe."
7799,Enough of what's out! What's in?
7800,"Yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way."
7801,"Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two..."
7802,All right. I can't waste any more time. People's lives are depending on me. Mr. Sulu -- make a left!
7803,That's it. Left. Left. Steady as she goes.
7804,"On second thought, go right."
7805,Oh my God! We're all gonna die!
7806,Y'ello.
7807,You mean water?
7808,I guess that's it. Ladies and gentlemen... We're in a tough spot and I don't know if we're gonna get out. Please remain calm and think of your loved ones.
7809,Bart!
7810,"I'll plug your hole. I mean, eureka!"
7811,"Mr. Moe, prepare to surface."
7812,Uhhh... it's my first day!
7813,Es mi dia primero. Wuo gang kai shuchun gong chuo Quack quack quack.
7814,Woo hoo!
7815,"You can't spell ""dishonorable"" without ""honorable."""
7816,"Well, I couldn't have done it without Bart."
7817,"Boy, I guess I was wrong about that earring. It saved us all."
7818,"I don't think so, son."
7819,No.
7820,Ask your mother.
7821,No.
7822,Maybe for Christmas.
7823,"Oh, will this horrible year never end?"
7824,Will you look at those morons? I paid my taxes over a year ago.
7825,"What is it, Sweetie? Did you see a scary picture in your picture book?"
7826,"No, because... You see I went ahead and... Year-wise, I was counting forward from the last previous..."
7827,I have a to do pile?
7828,"Marge, how many kids do we have? Oh, no time to count, I'll just estimate. Uh, nine."
7829,"Shutup! Shutup! If I don't hear you, it's not illegal. Okay, I need some deductions! Deductions! Ah! Business gifts!"
7830,Here you go. Keep using nuclear power.
7831,"Okay, Marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, Lisa's a clergyman, Maggie is seven people and Bart was wounded in Vietnam..."
7832,"If I don't see it, it's not illegal!"
7833,"Oh, no you don't!"
7834,"C'mon, get in there. Drop."
7835,Woo hoo!
7836,Well...
7837,Help! Somebody!
7838,"No, sir. I'm really sorry sir. An older boy told me to do it."
7839,"No sir, please. I can't go to prison. They pee in a cup and throw it on ya. I saw it in a movie!"
7840,"No, please, I'll do anything!"
7841,I'm very happy to meet you.
7842,"Okay, but could you pay me under the table? I got a little tax problem."
7843,"Not spy, squeal. I've got no choice."
7844,"Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president."
7845,Does this make me look fat?
7846,But not fat.
7847,"So if my cover gets blown and I need help, what's the signal?"
7848,"Hey, I see you're watchin' the ball game. Looks like a good one. Any of you involved in any illegal activity? Cause I could sure go for some."
7849,"How 'bout you, Lenny? Testing, testing? Lenny?"
7850,Maybe. But first I need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
7851,"Uhhhh, like those. But involving you."
7852,Barney? That was me! And I'd do it again.
7853,"Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. End transmission."
7854,"Well, I'm just glad it's all over."
7855,"Why do you keep picking on me? Marge's name was on that tax return, too."
7856,Walk? That wasn't part of the deal.
7857,Losers...
7858,Ooh! A trillion-dollar bill? 'Atsa spicy meatball!
7859,"But Mr. Burns gave me my job. And he hasn't fired me, even after three meltdowns and one China Syndrome. I can't betray him."
7860,I'm in.
7861,"Uh, I'm Homer Simpson, your trusted employee."
7862,"Uhh, I don't know what to tell you."
7863,"Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside..."
7864,Still cold.
7865,Starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
7866,"C'mon... Where are you?... Here, Trilly, Trilly."
7867,Uhmmmm... Errr... Uhhhhh...
7868,"Uh, yeah, sure. That thing."
7869,"No you don't. Heh, heh."
7870,Ewww!
7871,Is that a fish?
7872,"Hey, that guy looks like you."
7873,Is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
7874,"Wowww, that must be worth a fortune."
7875,"Hey, he's right..."
7876,I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.
7877,"Take that, Uncle Sam!"
7878,We'll hide out at my place. I've got beer.
7879,"Ohh, we're never gonna make it. Let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways."
7880,But I can't leave the country! What about my wife and kids?
7881,We'd better do what he says.
7882,Woo hoo! We can gamble!
7883,Yes!
7884,I call President!
7885,"Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge. There's shredded pork everywhere."
7886,Nice to meet you.
7887,I had no idea.
7888,"Mr. Burns, I think we can trust the President of Cuba."
7889,"It's hard to believe there's a place worse than America, but we found it."
7890,God bless America!
7891,"Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm."
7892,"That'll do it, Apu. So just--"
7893,"Helper monkey, eh?"
7894,"I'd like a monkey, please. And maybe one of those dogs. What do they do?"
7895,Do they do any other tricks?
7896,Just the monkey then.
7897,"Oh-ho-ho, I'm not handicapped. I'm just lazy."
7898,"Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back."
7899,Mind if I take him for a ride?
7900,"There a problem, honey?"
7901,"Relax. It's only Mojo. Mojo, Marge. Marge, Mojo. He can do anything you show him. Watch."
7902,Simpson residence.
7903,"This ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking."
7904,Marge! The kids are on!
7905,"Honey, he's clearly marked his territory."
7906,"Marge, can I get a duck?"
7907,Can he get a duck?
7908,Come on. Come to Poppa.
7909,"Good boy, Mojo. Now, bring 'em down and I'll give you one."
7910,Would you... Stop that! You're a helper monkey. This isn't helping!
7911,"Oh, I don't need your pity."
7912,And so on.
7913,"Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?"
7914,What do you want? His cholesterol's through the roof.
7915,"No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge your happy dance."
7916,"Lisa, don't you ruin another Love Day."
7917,They didn't have Lord Huggington?
7918,I guess.
7919,Kiss it.
7920,Oh-ho yeahhh...
7921,"Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime."
7922,Crap -- py -- stuff.
7923,Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled.
7924,"Ooh, but I can rebuild!"
7925,"Ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... Garbage water! Oh-ho-ho!"
7926,"You're pushin' me, baby."
7927,Hey wait! Stop! I have garbage!
7928,"You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags!"
7929,Uh oh.
7930,I don't know. A lot of people were yelling stuff.
7931,"That was yesterday, moron!"
7932,"Good news, everyone. I got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service."
7933,"Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men."
7934,"I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am."
7935,"Siddown, honey. The men will clear the table!"
7936,"So long, chicken bone."
7937,"No room for you, Jell-O."
7938,Sorry Ned. I didn't see you down there. Got him.
7939,Then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits Diaper Hill.
7940,"So-ho, the rats seem happy."
7941,That's not the way she tells it.
7942,"Uh, it's like the measles. Good to get it out of the way."
7943,"Yeah, but I'm always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack."
7944,Apologize for that remark.
7945,Attaboy!
7946,"Good morning, Trash Pile. How's about..."
7947,Hey! Woo-hoo! I won!
7948,"This is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. Your father, me, beat City Hall. It's just like David and Goliath, only this time David won."
7949,"And to think you wanted me to crawl, Marge! Well, this man doesn't crawl. He stands tall. That rhymes, Marge, and you know it rhymes. Admit it!"
7950,You signed my name? I feel so violated.
7951,"But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?"
7952,Perfect.
7953,"Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp."
7954,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras."
7955,"I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages."
7956,"You'll never silence me! I'm the last angry man, Patterson! A crusader for the little guy!"
7957,Never!
7958,You want to know what I think?
7959,"Well, we'll see about that."
7960,I want to register to run for Sanitation Commissioner. And tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!
7961,"Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating."
7962,"Hey, vote Simpson... Hi... Nice to see ya... Heh, thanks for comin' out... Keep puttin' on weight, huh? Lenny, my man."
7963,"What am I, the answer man? Just vote for me."
7964,These old geezers just don't get it. It's time to rock the vote.
7965,Potato man.
7966,"Take a hike, Kojak."
7967,"Hellooo Springfield! It's me, Homer!"
7968,"Quiet, you! I know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. But I also know you care about the race for Sanitation Commissioner. So, let me give ya the 911..."
7969,"That's a good question, Bono. 'Cause I'd be the most wack, tripped-out Sanitation Commissioner ever! Can ya dig it?"
7970,"Ow! Oh, Bono! Help me!"
7971,"My campaign is a disaster, Moe."
7972,"I hate the public so much. If only they'd elect me... I'd make 'em pay. Oh Moe, how do I make 'em like me?"
7973,Can't someone else do it?
7974,It is?
7975,Woo hoo!
7976,Can't someone else do it?
7977,Fellow citizens! How would you rate the trash service in this town?
7978,"Uh, okay, it's excellent. But aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?"
7979,Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
7980,Well then...
7981,"Well then, can't someone else do it?"
7982,And can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?
7983,"Well, Ray Patterson thinks you should do it! Animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. Did we lose a war? That's not America. That's not even Mexico."
7984,Don't you deserve better than the best?
7985,Who should handle all your dirty jobs?
7986,I'm sorry my opponent didn't think enough of you to show up for this debate. I'm sure he had more important things to do.
7987,"Well, then you shoulda been early."
7988,"Not if we hire more men. And my men will do all your messy jobs. They'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables..."
7989,"Well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, Pops."
7990,Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button?
7991,What-what-what. What button? Where am I? Who took my false teeth?
7992,Woo hoo!
7993,Fifty cents? Not likely.
7994,"Hey, Ray. Cleanin' out the old office, eh?"
7995,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Ray. Are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?"
7996,"Yeah, that was just a lie."
7997,"See? We're still friends. C'mon, give us a cuddle."
7998,"Jean-Paul, how are the new uniforms? Do they match the suede boots? Beautiful. Did you get the new trucks? Are they amphibious? Well, there's only one way to find out. We can always buy more."
7999,"Yes, I gotta work hard, honey. Daddy made a lot of crazy promises."
8000,"Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can."
8001,WHO CAN TAKE YOUR TRASH OUT? / STOMP IT DOWN FOR YOU? / SHAKE THE PLASTIC BAG AND DO THE TWISTY-THINGY TOO? / THE GARBAGE MAN...
8002,"Oh no! Wait, I think I've got the perfect solution."
8003,Patterson was right. I'm crashing and burning... crashing and burning...
8004,"They let me sign checks with a stamp, Marge. A stamp!"
8005,"Wait, shutup... I just thought of something!"
8006,"'Mornin', boys."
8007,Will cash be okay?
8008,"Okay, before I show ya, who wants to guess how I got the money?"
8009,"Close, but you're way off."
8010,"Look at that beautiful garbage! Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine."
8011,Marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.
8012,"Sure I can, Honey-kitten."
8013,"Uh, nothin'."
8014,"Now, uh, you were saying how great I was...?"
8015,Nay!
8016,Come to what?
8017,"Yeah, it's somethin', all right."
8018,"Yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? If you need me, I'll be at Moe's."
8019,Hi Moe.
8020,"Yeah, but can he do this?"
8021,What? They had a picnic last week.
8022,"If God didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin."
8023,"Ooo, still plenty of parking."
8024,"Yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. You're blocking the food."
8025,"Sorry, son, Daddy's down for the day. Why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?"
8026,Flanders is playing? Why didn't you say so?
8027,I agree. Let's surrender.
8028,"Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair."
8029,Stupid kids...
8030,Time out... t... time out...
8031,"Oh, stop it!"
8032,I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me.
8033,"Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this?"
8034,"Yeah, well, I've humiliated my son for the last time. I'm going to get into shape."
8035,"No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time."
8036,"Okay, boy, I want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. That way I won't be embarrassed if I fail."
8037,"Oh, great. Now the cat knows."
8038,"Okay, here we go..."
8039,"Look, son. Daddy got in shape. E--"
8040,"I've got to keep trying! Or I could just move that picture. No! The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside."
8041,Uhh... Don't you have anything healthy here?
8042,"Hey, these Power Sauce bars look pretty healthy."
8043,"Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow."
8044,"Gym? What's a ""Gym?"""
8045,Ohhh... a gym.
8046,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Boy, am I feeling this. Ow! Oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. Ow!"
8047,"Ranier Wolfcastle! Oh, I love your movies and your Power Sauce bars and your taut, rippling--"
8048,"Wow, Wolfie. Two months ago I didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. This place is great."
8049,"Hello, handsome. Nice muscles. Care for a rubdown? Oh-ho, well, I'm flattered, but spoken for. Oh, what the heck, give me your number."
8050,I have been working out secretly at night. And look at me now!
8051,"Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--"
8052,"No, not there."
8053,Not there either. Over here.
8054,"No, here. Try my foot. No, not that foot. Just feel my biceps."
8055,"Well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?"
8056,Damn right.
8057,How can you put that filth into your bodies?
8058,"Look at you people. Bart's a tub, Lisa's weak as a little girl, and Maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all."
8059,"You too, Marge. If you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action."
8060,"Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar."
8061,Hm.
8062,"Hospital, please."
8063,"Yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone."
8064,"Overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on."
8065,Huh?
8066,I am?
8067,"Okay, mountain-climbing supplies: rope, ice axe, heart medicine..."
8068,You? Did?
8069,"If you're trying to scare me, it won't work. I'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. Hey, my hat has ear flaps!"
8070,Huh?... Wha ya?... Hey! You guys are dragging me up the mountain.
8071,"That's right, Brad and Neil. I only eat Power Sauce -- the bar with Apple-saucicity."
8072,"Aww. Goodbye, everyone. Don't touch my stuff."
8073,"Well, yeah..."
8074,"Oh, man, this is hard."
8075,"Bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal I have ever faced."
8076,Wow! Look how far I climbed! And I'm not even tired!
8077,"Wake up, you lazy Sherpas. We've got a mountain to climb!"
8078,"So nobody believes I can do this, huh? Well, my son does. And I'm not gonna let him down. I'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own."
8079,Shut up. You are so fired.
8080,"Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home and I'm heading for the top, solo."
8081,The hell I won't. You're forgetting I've got my Power Sauce bars.
8082,"Hey, Deng Xiao-Ping died."
8083,Forget it. I'll be at the top by noon. Over and out.
8084,"Air's getting thin, but I'm gonna make it. Woo! Getting lightheaded... Good -- no heavy head to carry. Wait! I'll just take that escalator!"
8085,La la la la la la la la...
8086,La la la la la la la la la...
8087,Just a few feet more...
8088,"I did it! I made it all the way to... Aw, crap!"
8089,"It just keeps going! I give up. You beat me, mountain!"
8090,At least I won't freeze to death.
8091,"""Last entry. I have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. Worse still, that treacherous skunk Abe Simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."""
8092,"Ew, Dad. ""Tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing Abe Simpson. Cheerio."""
8093,"My Dad's a disgrace, just like Bart's Dad. Me."
8094,"This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpson's ever gonna get."
8095,"This is for you, son."
8096,"Hey. Wait a minute. I'm on the top. I actually did it. I climbed the unclimbable mountain! Bow down before me, everyone! For I am your KING!"
8097,Hi.
8098,"Oh, Marge, I never thought you'd see me again."
8099,"Why don't you tell me, son? See any interesting flags up there?"
8100,"Aw, dammit!"
8101,"Thanks, Bart. That makes it all worthwhile."
8102,"'Mornin', Barney."
8103,"Huh? Whuh? Hyuwhuh? I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm a productive member of the team! You can't fire me, I quit! Please, I have a family! Well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer."
8104,Eh. Eh.
8105,Aha. There's some glue.
8106,Hope this stuff holds.
8107,Hello?
8108,Who is this?
8109,Museum? I don't like the sound of that. What did your mother say?
8110,"Hmm. So you want to take the bus, huh? I don't know. That's a pretty big decision..."
8111,Two hundred dollars?! Isn't there any other way?
8112,"Frankly, I do. I know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus."
8113,"Atta girl. I love you, sweet --"
8114,"My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus."
8115,"MMMaybe... but you don't know Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire."
8116,"Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter."
8117,Lisa!
8118,"You have reached the office of Homer Simpson. If you are calling about the waterbed, please leave a detailed message. If you need--"
8119,Lisa?! Lisa?! Li-sa?!
8120,"Oh, where is she?"
8121,Has anyone seen my little girl?
8122,"For God's sakes, my little girl is--"
8123,Hello.
8124,I am at work. This is what I do.
8125,"Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot."
8126,"Uh, yes sir, Mr. Burns, sir."
8127,"Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?"
8128,Lisa... Lisa...
8129,This is no good. I've got to get up higher.
8130,Give me all your balloons.
8131,I hope this works...
8132,These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.
8133,Lisa? Lisa? Lisa!
8134,Stay there! I'll come down and save you!
8135,Lisa! Save me!
8136,"Oh, no! I'm gonna go off the end of the --"
8137,"I'm not normally a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman."
8138,"Oh, Lisa, thank God you're okay!"
8139,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oww!
8140,"Nah, I'll just walk it off."
8141,Don't ever say that.
8142,"If I hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker, I never would have found you."
8143,"Stupid risks are what make life worth living. Now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. But me, I'm a risk taker. And that's why I have so many adventures."
8144,"Feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? That's what my heart's doing all the time. Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?"
8145,"I'm enjoying my life too much to care. And you should be too. So what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!"
8146,"Closed, eh? So getting in would be a pretty big risk. What do you say, honey? Feeling stupid? I know I am."
8147,Just a little higher...
8148,Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.
8149,Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file.
8150,Uh... not this exquisite.
8151,"Well, Daddy will figure it out."
8152,"Lisa, you can't go this far and then not go further."
8153,"Oh, so now it's we, eh."
8154,"Anytime, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us."
8155,"Yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it."
8156,It is? Well... that's a good song too. Do do do do-do do do...
8157,Run!
8158,"Look, honey, I clipped on my tie all by myself."
8159,"Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge."
8160,"Hey, look what was in here. A program from that guy's funeral."
8161,"Yeah, him. Whatever happened to that guy?"
8162,"But Marge, the Gilded Truffle is an intimate, elegant place."
8163,You mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? Why was I not informed?
8164,"Hey Marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? Wee little parties?"
8165,Gotcha!
8166,"Another super year with a super lady. Good night, honey."
8167,"You know, um, it is a special occasion..."
8168,Yeah. Seems like the thing to do.
8169,"So, you gonna..."
8170,"Oh. No. No, I'm the guy. I'm supposed to, uh..."
8171,"I know, but let me get you started first."
8172,All right. How's that?
8173,"Oh, sorry."
8174,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
8175,"No, no. Don't do that."
8176,"I know, but I don't like it."
8177,Ahh!
8178,Look who's here!
8179,He's the best boy!
8180,"Hey, Marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?"
8181,I love that dog.
8182,G'night.
8183,"Hmm, that's queer."
8184,What?
8185,The food!
8186,Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?
8187,Okay.
8188,"It was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. Plus I'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than I let on."
8189,"Eh, I never thought I'd live this long."
8190,"I'll get us out of this, honey. It's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'."
8191,Hmmm...
8192,"When you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt."
8193,Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these farmers have pitchforks.
8194,That was close!
8195,"At your service, milady."
8196,Cara mia...
8197,"Bart, I told you not to leave that TV on."
8198,"No, no, honey. Maybe this will help."
8199,"Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast."
8200,"Nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all."
8201,"Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?"
8202,"If there's anything more exquisite than Queen Anne's lace, I haven't found it."
8203,Are you ready to rock? 'Cause heeere we go!
8204,"Um, no time like the present."
8205,"Well, yeah, kinda..."
8206,Did that butter churn just move? 'Cause if it did...
8207,Mine too. Just like back in that hay loft.
8208,"There's the dirty girl I married. Come on, I have a disgusting idea."
8209,They didn't hear us in the sewing room.
8210,"Hello, everybody."
8211,Bart! Yes.
8212,Awww... Eskimo kiss!
8213,I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.
8214,Not yet. Wait... wait... wait... now!
8215,It hasn't changed since that magical evening when I knocked you up.
8216,"Yeah, I thought Bart would be born a dimwit."
8217,"Well, this time I'm drunk on love... and beer."
8218,"Oh, why can't they just play through?"
8219,"Ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?"
8220,"Marge, can we trade? I don't trust these guys."
8221,"Y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--"
8222,Okay!
8223,Gil! Thank God it's you. You gotta help us.
8224,"Honey, my shoulders are separating."
8225,"Oh, we're surrounded, Marge. Maybe we should give ourselves up."
8226,"Yeah, the British tabloids will have a field day. There's only one thing left to do."
8227,"Grab onto the handles, Marge."
8228,"Okay, I think I've figured this thing out. It can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time."
8229,These have pleats...
8230,"I'm okay, honey. Now listen very carefully. I want you to pull on the thing that's near the other thing."
8231,"No, that was not the thing."
8232,Thank you...
8233,"Marge, uh, can we not land here?... Honey?... Baby doll...?"
8234,Why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.
8235,Dads especially!
8236,Scary ways. But we never intended it to end like that. With thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.
8237,Who's in the mood for miniature golf?
8238,Can't you just write on your arm like I do?
8239,"Yo, Apu, gimme the usual."
8240,"Hey, this hot dog tastes different."
8241,"Uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus."
8242,People buy grease?
8243,"Used grease is worth money? Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. I'm rich, Apu! Rich, I--!"
8244,Money in the bank.
8245,"Okay, this bacon's done."
8246,And now for the profit taking.
8247,Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.
8248,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence."
8249,"No, through savings and wise investments. Of course with grease!"
8250,Where do you think you're goin'?
8251,Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.
8252,"Okay, boy, this is where all the hard work, sacrifice, and painful scaldings pay off."
8253,Woo hoo!
8254,"Yeah, but your Mom paid for that."
8255,And I get my money from grease. What's the problem?
8256,"Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation."
8257,"Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives."
8258,"Li-sa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way."
8259,"Uh-uh, think. Is that what Alex would say?"
8260,Oh I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid. There must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
8261,All right. We'll try it your way.
8262,"My God, you're greasy."
8263,"If she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys."
8264,"Hey, what the...?"
8265,"Hey, hey, you're taking our grease!"
8266,"Hey, that's my shovel."
8267,"Oh, I can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. I've been muscled out of everything I've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business."
8268,"Oh, what's the point?"
8269,"Emus? Really? Oh, that's pretty crazy... Nah... I'd only fail just like I fail at everything."
8270,"Wait a minute. The boy's right! I can't quit now. Aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. Emu farm... You're priceless, Marge."
8271,"All right, son, we're about to embark on our most difficult mission. Let's bow our heads in prayer."
8272,"Dear Lord, I know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. But if you help us steal this grease tonight, I promise we'll donate half the profits to charity."
8273,"All right, screw it. Let's roll."
8274,Mmm... I knew I should have attached those somehow.
8275,"This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm."
8276,"Okay, turn on the suction."
8277,It's not working.
8278,What is it?
8279,Bringin' up the rear.
8280,"Oh, yeah."
8281,"Well, here goes..."
8282,And now we wait. So... is this your school?
8283,"Uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... Scotland."
8284,Uhh... North... Kilt... town?
8285,"Wait a minute, there's no Angus MacCloud in North Kilt-town. Why you're not from Scotland at all!"
8286,Ow! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful!
8287,"Bart, please. The groundskeeper and I are trying to settle this like adults."
8288,That's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!
8289,Website.
8290,Seventy-six point two?! But I'm already thirty-eight point one! I've wasted half my life!
8291,Half my life gone! And I'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.
8292,Marge! I've wasted half my life.
8293,"What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a..."
8294,"Okay, send the truck."
8295,"No, I don't deserve sugar. I'm halfway to my grave, and I haven't accomplished anything. Oh, I am not looking forward to my funeral."
8296,"Marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for Lenny."
8297,"Oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that."
8298,"I've wasted half my life, Marge. Do you know how many memories I have? Three! Standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. Thirty-eight years and that's all I have to show for it."
8299,Cold.
8300,Oh. I see you're having a party. I'll come back later.
8301,"Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint where my life went wrong."
8302,All we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage Mir.
8303,No.
8304,Hike.
8305,"Oh, I shoulda punted. Turn it off! Turn it off!"
8306,"Stupid movies. Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart?"
8307,"No one man can do all that. You're a liar, honey. A dirty, rotten liar."
8308,"Really? A restaurant? Well, now I don't know what to think."
8309,"Cut it out, boy!"
8310,Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back.
8311,"Ooh, look at all the inventions Edison came up with. The stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. And look at him dance."
8312,De de de de de.
8313,"And these Hardy Boys books are great, too. This one is about smugglers."
8314,"No, not this one. ""The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."" It's about pirates."
8315,I think it's pretty obvious that I am.
8316,Go school!
8317,Not the way I quit. Ooh-who.
8318,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny. But here's one that's even more spellbinding. Once upon a time there was a man named Thomas Edison. And he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph..."
8319,"... And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was Alva. And he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. And..."
8320,"Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park. That's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and..."
8321,That's boring. You're boring everybody. Quit boring everyone!
8322,... And then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. Some kind of scary telephone I guess. Or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell.
8323,"Ohh, that's where you're wrong, Marge. He was a shameless self-promoter."
8324,"Marge, that's it! That's why I haven't done anything with my life! I need to be more like Thomas Edison!"
8325,And I'm starting right now. No more lousy pajamas!
8326,"From this day forward, I am an inventor!"
8327,"Well, I quit my job just like you said to."
8328,"Yes, you did. I remember your exact words. You said I should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house."
8329,"At my age Edison had already invented 203 things. Ohh, I've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him."
8330,Let's see now... inventions... inventions...
8331,"What? Eh. Eh. Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge. You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do."
8332,"You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables."
8333,My files!
8334,"Uh, this isn't working. I've got to try a different approach."
8335,Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day.
8336,Shutup.
8337,"As long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session. Now, here's how it works: Lisa, you say one thing, then Bart, you say another. Just toss out things and I'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea."
8338,Okay.
8339,Uh-huh.
8340,"A-- Wait a minute! These aren't exciting new products! You're not even trying. Okay, that's it. Both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves."
8341,I don't see why not. They're my kids. I own 'em.
8342,"Okay, we own 'em."
8343,"Ohhh, it's no use. I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community."
8344,You stay here and guard the sandwich.
8345,"Look, I just want to know how to invent things. Tell me."
8346,You mean like an electric blanketmobile?
8347,Hamburger earmuffs!
8348,"Thanks, sucker!"
8349,"Okay, I have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind."
8350,"First, my All-Purpose Electric Hammer. ""For all your pounding needs."""
8351,Ow!
8352,Probably needs to be more powerful.
8353,"Now, here's my ""Everything's Okay"" Alarm."
8354,This will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.
8355,It can't be turned off.
8356,"But it does break easily. Now this next one's for the ladies. How many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?"
8357,"That's why I invented this revolutionary makeup gun. It's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready. Close your eyes, Marge."
8358,And now you're ready for a night on the town.
8359,"Eh. Oh. Okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed."
8360,"Oh, look what you did. Now I have to get my cold cream gun."
8361,Women will like what I tell them to like. Now here's something for everyone.
8362,"In the olden times, if you were watching TV and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. But now, with the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip."
8363,"Sure! Believe me, every man in America will want to have one."
8364,Yes?
8365,Yes? Yes? Yes?
8366,What?
8367,But this is the best I could do. I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson.
8368,"All week, my life long dream was to be the next Thomas Edison, but now it's over. I guess I'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father."
8369,"Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff."
8370,Really? You think it's a good idea?
8371,I did it! I'm gonna be rich!
8372,"Look, Mr. Edison, I did it. I'm an inventor! And I owe it all to you."
8373,"See? It's just a regular chair, but I attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your..."
8374,AWDAMMIT!
8375,"I thought I had a great idea, but I must've seen it on this poster."
8376,It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it.
8377,That chair might be the only one he made.
8378,"So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it! Then I'll be an inventor!"
8379,"Aw, to hell with him!"
8380,Taking-Bart-across-state-lines-Back-soon.
8381,I borrowed your wallet!
8382,"Oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like Thomas Edison, Jr. You know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. Oh, and later, he raised turkeys. That was on his turkey farm."
8383,Now let's take care of business.
8384,"Outta the way. This is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!"
8385,"Invent your way out of this, Edison."
8386,"Look, son. Edison was just like me."
8387,No! We both lived in another man's shadow. This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache.
8388,"We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. I can't destroy your work, my friend."
8389,"No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum on the way home..."
8390,"Oh. Well then, we'll take it out on Eli Whitney."
8391,Yay! / All right! / Woo-hoo! /
8392,That's my Tommy.
8393,Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.
8394,"Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone!"
8395,"All right. One for ""resident""..."
8396,"Well, that's it."
8397,I needed my power fix.
8398,"Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward."
8399,"Man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooo, go-carts! C'mon everybody, let's go."
8400,"Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!"
8401,Stand back and watch the pro.
8402,Nah. They mess up my hair.
8403,Ooh. Ball one.
8404,Ball two. This Bozo's gonna walk me.
8405,Hey!
8406,"You're going down, you--"
8407,Oh! Oh! Why you-- Hey you-- You better-- I'm gonna-- If you k--
8408,I rolled up all the socks.
8409,What's next?
8410,All right.
8411,I hate folding sheets.
8412,"Well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. Where's Bart?"
8413,"It's okay, Marge. I'll get him. BA-ART!"
8414,MILHOUSE!
8415,TELL BART TO COME HOME!
8416,WHO'S NELSON?
8417,"All right, young lady. I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer."
8418,"And get a little something for yourself, sweetheart."
8419,I'unno. Drug lab?
8420,"Or reading comic books. What am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing."
8421,"Oh, man. This is the most exciting thing I've seen since Haley's Comet collided with the moon!"
8422,Sure it didn't.
8423,"Ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? And would it kill you to make some coffee?"
8424,Why is this taking so long? Bart was born in about five minutes.
8425,"Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
8426,I see a horn!
8427,"Aww... Ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur."
8428,That is one vicious baby bird.
8429,Enough bickering. I know how to settle this.
8430,"If anyone wants me, I'll be eating alone in the basement."
8431,Stupid cards.
8432,"I'm proud of you, boy. Mmmm, loganberry."
8433,The chair? How come they only do crucifixions during sweeps?
8434,"Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!"
8435,"This is legal, right?"
8436,Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
8437,"Later, chickie-pie."
8438,You sent me to the chair.
8439,"I know you are, but what am I?"
8440,"It's hammer time, Snitchy."
8441,"Oh, my God!"
8442,"Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna, like, totally waste you."
8443,Yoink.
8444,Don't worry. I'll protect you... Little dude.
8445,There. Now no murderers can get in... or out.
8446,You are sooo dead.
8447,"Come here, you little--"
8448,"Daddy would like a word with you, Barty!"
8449,But I look so youthful and hunky.
8450,The kid's gotta die.
8451,But I love my son.
8452,More than a lush head of hair?
8453,Don't make me choose!
8454,Nooooo!
8455,"I love you, son."
8456,"I'll show you, hair!"
8457,Idiot?! Why you... little...
8458,... Show you...
8459,... I'll Kill you!
8460,"It wasn't me, it was the hair!"
8461,Going where?
8462,Mama took those batteries / She took 'em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A...
8463,Ooh. How are Bart and Lisa gonna get out of this one?
8464,Bor-ing.
8465,"Huh? Oh, okay... Let's see... ""pause,"" ""three,"" no ""fa-fa""..."
8466,Hee hee hee hee. Look how cute they are.
8467,Look at him go.
8468,Ohh... Ahh...
8469,I just lost my appetite.
8470,"Wait, mine came back."
8471,I know how to cheer you up.
8472,"This little piggy went to Kwik-E-Mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--"
8473,Ooh!
8474,"Look, Marge! Maggie lost her baby legs!"
8475,All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the...
8476,"Bad baby! Oh, she's entering the terrible twos, all right."
8477,"Is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?"
8478,"Hello-- Oh, great. Mormons."
8479,Huh? What are you talking about?
8480,You intergalactic hussy! How could you?! Was he better than me?
8481,"Well, we can't compete with that, but--"
8482,"It made me angry, Jerry. Angry and tired."
8483,"One-eyed, two-timing ! I'm gonna !"
8484,"C'mon, Maggie. Let's go home."
8485,"Oh, I was having the most wonderful dream. I had a hat, and a tie with no pants on."
8486,I promise you kids lots of things. That's what makes me such a good father.
8487,"No, that would make me a great father."
8488,"Aw, four A.M. Now I'll never get back to..."
8489,"""Magilla Gorilla, gorilla for sale..."" Hey, you shouldn'ta oughta taken my banana, Mr. Peebles."
8490,"Screw this. Hang on, everyone. We're takin' the ol' Simpson shortcut."
8491,"So long, suckers!"
8492,"Eat my dust, suckers!"
8493,"Mmmm. Ugh, pesticides! Carbomate, if I'm not mistaken. Yep, Carbomate."
8494,I see it.
8495,"Well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies."
8496,Lower! Lower!
8497,"Yep. That's where they cook up their ""vittles."""
8498,"Okay, remember where we parked."
8499,"Oh yeah, couldn't put it down."
8500,"C'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack."
8501,"Ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me."
8502,Life jackets?
8503,Tow rope?
8504,Skier?
8505,Here we go!
8506,"Ooh, look at it go."
8507,"Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!"
8508,"Heads up. Comin' through. Look out! Hey, volley ball. Can I play later? Hi, Apu."
8509,Higher!
8510,"Bye-bye, fishies! Higher! Higherrr!"
8511,"I'm soaring! Soaring majestically like a candy wrapper caught in an updraft! Higher, Marge! Higher!"
8512,"Higher, I say! I want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! I want to look down on the clouds with contempt! I want to sneer at God's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh."
8513,"Oh, this is not good."
8514,"Aw, nuts."
8515,"What? Oh, already?"
8516,"Sorry, lady. I know you. You're Kim Basinger"
8517,"Ohhh my God, I am such a huge, huge fan of yours, Miss Basinger."
8518,"Well, I am a married man..."
8519,Billy Baldwin!
8520,"So, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?"
8521,Wait! Tell me over breakfast. Who's for pancakes?
8522,"Oh, I don't want to be a bother. Anyway, what are you two big Hollywood stars doing in good ol' Springfield?"
8523,"Oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... Bethesda?"
8524,"Yeah, tell you the truth, I'm not even sure."
8525,"A gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses."
8526,You shouldn't have to survive on dry crumbly muffins from... the Gersh Agency. You should let me do your shopping. I know where I can get you some great muffins.
8527,"Okay, fine. But I could do all kinds of stuff for you. I noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken."
8528,"Please, Homer. C'mon, if you let me hang around a while, I can do all kinds of stuff for ya."
8529,"Yeah, you owe me that much."
8530,Absolutely. If you promise to keep mine.
8531,I can't read.
8532,I recognized the logo.
8533,Nowhere famous.
8534,Gersh Agency.
8535,"Apu, I'm about to purchase some weird and fruity items, and I don't want any guff. First of all, I'll need the following mushrooms: portobello --"
8536,Porcini --
8537,Chanterelle --
8538,AAAnd Shiitake.
8539,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just broadening my horizons. Uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a Humvee?"
8540,"Ooo, me-ow."
8541,I'll get it! I'll get it!
8542,Yes?
8543,Ron Howard?!
8544,Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger?!
8545,"Really? You giant stars consider me a friend? Well, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm somebody. Ronny, are you also my close friend?"
8546,It's called a Lawnmower. I invented it. You want one?
8547,Sure. We'll all stay.
8548,I'll do that! You go upstairs and have a beer.
8549,Kent Brockman. Please.
8550,"Well, you know me. I love animals. Beef, chicken, veal... if you're not part of the solution, Marge, you're part of the problem."
8551,Imagine Films.
8552,"A, uh... division of, um... Homer-Co."
8553,"And lift, and strain, and hy-per-extend, keep those knees rigid, jerk that lower back..."
8554,"That's right, force it. Whip that neck."
8555,"Oh, there's that movie script I wrote. Where did you find it?"
8556,"The important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. Either one of you. It's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. Ron Howard's attached to direct."
8557,"Well, he expressed an interest."
8558,Did too!
8559,You lie!
8560,So you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?
8561,"Well, if Alec is out, I'm out too. You're on your own, Potsie."
8562,I might have.
8563,"Oh, I can't. I promised I wouldn't."
8564,Who the hell are you?
8565,"All right, I'm gonna let you guys in on something. But you've got to keep it much more secret than I did."
8566,Unbelievable?
8567,"Nothing, nothing. Good hustle."
8568,Uh-oh.
8569,"I'm looking at you, Horshak."
8570,"Okay, okay, it was me. I'm sorry I blew your secret. But you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. I just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. Reflected glory!"
8571,But where will I bask?
8572,"Come on, Ron, we're not wanted here."
8573,"All right, I'll go. But the next time you want someone to remind you which brother is which, or smell your hair while you're sleeping, just remember, old Homer won't be here anymore."
8574,"Oh, how could Alec and Kim just cut me out of their lives?"
8575,"When Kim makes a Manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. And would it kill you to put some fennel in it?"
8576,"Oh, it was so great. I didn't have to fake it with them. I was actually excited to hear about their day."
8577,Was it the dog from the Beethoven movies?
8578,Our dog isn't famous. And you kids aren't exactly John and Joan Cusack. And you. You couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. I'm about ready to ankle this family.
8579,See? It's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. The only one who understands me is that guy who married Martha Raye.
8580,"Hmmm... She may not be famous, but she's right. Those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. I did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... And I've still got a car full of their crap. Crap, eh...?"
8581,Attention starstruck fools!
8582,Step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of Alec-and-Ron-and-Kim-arabilia.
8583,"Only 5, no wait 10 dollars. You heard right, 20 dollars."
8584,"That's right, Mister Tough Guy can't handle a little penicillin. Oh, and look at this. We can't even pay our bills and they're drinking Royal Crown Cola."
8585,"Oh, yeah? What have they ever done for you? When was the last time Barbra Streisand cleaned out your garage? And when it's time to do the dishes, where's Ray Bolger? I'll tell ya. Ray Bolger is lookin' out for Ray Bolger!"
8586,Why you little--!
8587,"Ooh, look at me! I'm Kim Basinger, the big movie star! I'm so beautiful! I think I'm so great! I'm too important to take Homer to the Oscars."
8588,Gotta-go-thank-you-for-supporting-the-Museum-of-Hollywood-Jerks.
8589,"Oh, I'll never outrun them in a museum!"
8590,No!
8591,"Oh, God."
8592,"Okay, I'll stop."
8593,"Yes, I do."
8594,"I believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. If celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively."
8595,"In closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. And when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. Thank you, Your Honor."
8596,"Well, I'll always have my crank calls. Hello, old lady from ""Titanic""? You stink!"
8597,"All righty, I'll just-- You stinkin' g--"
8598,"But with college behind us, we'll need careers. And good ones."
8599,"Slow down, fellas. I've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future."
8600,"Oh, am I?"
8601,It's the job of tomorrow... today!
8602,"Well, that settles it. For all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... Line."
8603,Nuclear power.
8604,"Pretty good, huh?"
8605,"Well, there were script problems from day one."
8606,"That was the problem. The important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, I'm finally getting some decent parts."
8607,"I didn't choose to be a gifted actor, Marge. It chose me. I'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. Now help me make up some phony credits."
8608,Good. Good.
8609,"You know... I have no idea. Hey, Dad. What does the ""J"" stand for?"
8610,But I can't ask Mom. She's on the run from the law.
8611,No! Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form. He never has and he never will.
8612,"Yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. The point is, I'm a grown man, and I deserve a middle name."
8613,Great. I'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.
8614,"Wow, look at this place. There's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... I can actually feel the good vibrations."
8615,Oww... ch.
8616,You went to Woodstock?
8617,"Lather, rinse, and repeat. Always repeat."
8618,"Wow, I could have lived like that?"
8619,"Ohh, my mother painted that for me?"
8620,"Oh, my God! My middle name is right behind that shrub. I'll finally know what ""J"" stands for! From this moment forth, I will be known as Homer...Jay Simpson. It's so beautiful. What a magical gift for my mother to leave me."
8621,I'll treasure this poncho forever.
8622,"My head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. I'll do it!"
8623,"I'm gonna be a hippie, just like Mom wanted. I'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of God's creatures!"
8624,"Get off, you stupid dog!"
8625,"Okay, if I'm gonna be a real hippie, I have to learn from the master, Mr. Bob ""flower child"" Hope."
8626,Bummer... love-in... Dean Rusk... By George I've got it!
8627,"Your potato? You can't like own a potato, man. It's one of Mother Earth's creatures."
8628,"No way, narc. Bodily functions are a natural thing."
8629,"Why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? Marge, you've got too many hang-ups. Like the whole shaving trip. C'mon, I want to see those legs all furry and gross."
8630,"Well, at least lose the bra. Free the ""Springfield Two,"" Marge! Free the ""Springfield Two!"""
8631,"C'mon, Maude. The human wang is a beautiful thing."
8632,"Okay, okay. Narc."
8633,Heads up!
8634,Right on.
8635,"That was cool. Think I'll stick around. We've got everything we need right here. Good times, sunshine, free love..."
8636,Work!? But you're hippies!
8637,What is this place?
8638,"Profits, profits, profits! What kinda hippies are you? Peter Fonda must be spinning in his grave."
8639,"Oh, yeah? When's the last time you freaked out the establishment? You guys are total sellouts."
8640,"Look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. C'mon, where's your freak bus?"
8641,A Saturn?
8642,Fine. I guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
8643,Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!
8644,Ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. I brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
8645,"Hey square, expand your mind! The doors of perception are open for business."
8646,"Never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!"
8647,"Hi, Marge. We're freaking out squares!"
8648,"What's in your brand new bag, mama?"
8649,Marge. Not in front of the hippies.
8650,Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!
8651,Woo hoo!
8652,"No, no, no. Marge was definitely freaked out."
8653,"Uh. Pretty, uh, freaky, huh?"
8654,I'm sensing some negative vibes here. But I promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
8655,"Yes, b-b-but the poncho..."
8656,B-b-but the poncho...
8657,Uh-oh.
8658,"Aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf, but really it was my fault. I just don't have the discipline to be a hippie."
8659,Perhaps in time.
8660,"Aww, you're just saying that."
8661,"Well, I do walk through pretty much anything... Ohh, you kids are sweet."
8662,That's it! Somehow!
8663,"Sleep gentle hippies, sleep. Let old Homer Jay set things right."
8664,"Good morning, Starshine. Seth."
8665,"I picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in town. Your business is saved!"
8666,Heh. That's what I thought at first. But then I found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.
8667,"Well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!"
8668,"Not so fast, Pig! We're making a stand. A freaky stand! You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!"
8669,"Seth, Munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. ""UPTOWN GIRL / SHE'S BEEN LIVING IN HER WHITE-BREAD WORLD..."" Come on, guys... UPTOWN GIRL..."
8670,"Look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man."
8671,"Hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. Yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on."
8672,Freedom...
8673,Love...
8674,And peace.
8675,Can't you just prune some of the leaves so I can watch TV?
8676,That's no fun.
8677,Don't make me come up there!
8678,Woo hoo!
8679,"Hang in there, son. I'm taking us out for our traditional Sunday brunch."
8680,"He zinged you, Marge."
8681,Brunch is served!
8682,"Why? We're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free."
8683,"Cherry Garcia... Honey Bono... Desmond Tutti Fruitti... Lisa, help Daddy find some normal flavors."
8684,"Nooo, nothing made of dead guys. What's in the back?"
8685,Hurry up. My hands are getting cold.
8686,Sherbet Hoover?
8687,Ooooh.
8688,"Hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? Oh, I can't afford that."
8689,Unless...
8690,"I tell ya, I'm a financial genius. I buy an eight-dollar lobster, fatten it into an eighty-dollar lobster, and eat the profits."
8691,I'm way ahead of you.
8692,Hold on. I'm still fine-tuning.
8693,Uh-oh.
8694,Perfect.
8695,No problem. I picked some up at the store.
8696,Nothing's too good for my one and only.
8697,"Eat, eat! You're nothing but skin and bones."
8698,"Okay, together, we weigh three hundred pounds. According to my driver's license, I weigh 140 pounds."
8699,"That means that you weigh... One hundred and sixty pounds! Oh-ho-ho, you're doin' great!"
8700,"Good news, my delicious friend! You're going to be a free-range lobster."
8701,"C'mon, boy, dig in. They'll give you a big, strong thorax."
8702,"Aw, look at him cower, just like the boy. I can't stay mad at such a helpless little mammal."
8703,"Oh, I'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!"
8704,"Take that, Pinchy."
8705,"Well, I guess this is it, ol' pal. This is your big day."
8706,Uh...
8707,Okay...
8708,"But Marge, look at the little guy!"
8709,"Feel that, Marge? He likes you!"
8710,And now for the main course...
8711,Steamed Maine cabbages!
8712,We're not eating Mr. Pinchy. He's part of the family now.
8713,"Pinchy, I made you some risotto."
8714,"What's your problem, Veggie? You don't even eat lobster."
8715,"Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?"
8716,That's my girl!
8717,"Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look."
8718,Here's a little playmate for you.
8719,"Hey, you don't have to take that from no punk-ass crab. What's wrong with you?"
8720,Wooo!!
8721,"Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath."
8722,Yeah... Pinchy?... Pinchy?!... Oh... Pinchy!!!
8723,"Oh, man, that's good. Pass the butter."
8724,"Uh-huh. Pinchy would have wanted it this way. My dear, sweet Pinchy. No more pain where you are now, boy."
8725,"Oh God, that's tasty. I wish Pinchy were here to enjoy this. Ohhh, Pinchy!"
8726,"Hey, I'm trying to drive here!"
8727,Uh-oh. Tape must have fallen off.
8728,"There, problem solved."
8729,"Relax, she just needs a little lovin'."
8730,"Come on, come on, come on. Start, damn you. Start!"
8731,Two hours? Why'd they build this ghost town so far away?
8732,"It's because they're stupid, that's why. That's why everybody does everything."
8733,Three minutes?
8734,Do we have to listen to you?
8735,I'm done.
8736,"Hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!"
8737,"Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!"
8738,Duh.
8739,"What the heck is this, a tea party? Somebody kill somebody!"
8740,"But it's funny, Marge. The guy's sick."
8741,"Oh, we've gotta get home. I don't wanna miss, ""Inside the Actor's Studio."" Tonight it's F. Murray Abraham."
8742,F. Murray Abraham.
8743,Can't stop now. We're making great time.
8744,"What are you, an animal?"
8745,"Whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it."
8746,"Wow, get a load of that toilet."
8747,"We're almost home, Dad. Only a couple more times over the horizon."
8748,You just sit back and relax. I'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
8749,"Yep, that's what happens when you get older. It's one of those natural things. Beautiful in its way."
8750,"Excuse me, doctor. I think I know a little something about medicine..."
8751,So... you're saying I don't need a new muffler?
8752,"Oh, I blame myself for this."
8753,"C'mon, Doc. There's gotta be something I can do to help my dad."
8754,"A kidney? Okay, fine."
8755,"I said ""fine."" What is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?"
8756,"Pork chops, sloppy joes, hot dogs, and pork chops?"
8757,"Well now that's what I always thought, but somehow..."
8758,"""Apes-A-Poppin'!"" Oooh, the airline version!"
8759,Nothing's too good for me.
8760,"Ahhh. I'm the luckiest man in the world, now that Lou Gehrig's dead."
8761,"It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it's just a procedure."
8762,Really? You think it's dangerous?
8763,Procedure. Deadly procedure.
8764,Now you're just tryin' to scare me.
8765,But I don't want that.
8766,"Yeah, I guess."
8767,"Well, actually I-- Hey! Quit harvesting me with your eyes!"
8768,"Marge, I've been thinking. What if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, I gave Grampa that artificial kidney I invented?"
8769,"But I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. Why didn't somebody tell me what I was volunteering for? This is everybody's fault but mine."
8770,"Is that the same Jack from ""Jack and the Beanstalk""?"
8771,"And Jack Sprat? Is that him, too?"
8772,Is he the same as Jack be nimble? And Jack Frost? And little Jack Horner?
8773,All gone!
8774,I owe Dad so much. Those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
8775,"You're right, Marge. I'll do it. But if I die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?"
8776,Blow up the hospital.
8777,That's my girl.
8778,Liability waiver?
8779,"Yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... I don't usually sign stuff like that."
8780,Oh.
8781,"I love you, Dad."
8782,I'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
8783,Even those guys look too civilized for me.
8784,I could live at sea! The sea forgives all. Not like those mean old mountains. I hate them so much.
8785,Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
8786,"Uh, excuse me, I'm fleeing in shame and I'd like to look my best."
8787,"Um, can I be a mate on your ship? Preferably First Mate."
8788,"Oh, I like taffy, but I don't deserve taffy."
8789,A tramp steamer! That's perfect!
8790,"Oh, I'd like to apply for a job. Any job. If you don't have a captain, I could be that."
8791,I've been on that one. The taffy shop.
8792,"The name on the back says ""Honeybunch."""
8793,"Well, actually, you did..."
8794,"Say, who are you guys?"
8795,"H-Heyy, let me off this thing."
8796,Whew.
8797,Forget what?
8798,"Well, back on land, my name was Homer Simpson. And I guess it is here, too. I promised my Dad one of my kidneys, but I chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed."
8799,"Well, yeah, I know..."
8800,That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.
8801,Even the sea won't forgive me.
8802,"Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. Well, I guess it's up to me to take the first step."
8803,"All right, this is it. No more living in shame. I'm going to show my family the kind of man I really am."
8804,"All right, I'm gonna..."
8805,"No you're not, Dad."
8806,"I'm sorry, Dad. The way I behaved was shameful. I guess fear made me run away. But love made me come back."
8807,"Boy, that..."
8808,Ow!
8809,"I'm sorry I ran off again. Oh, I guess Dad must be dead by now. When I get better, and after I've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave..."
8810,It's a miracle! You recovered!
8811,What? What? Hey!
8812,You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--
8813,"Don't you dance out that door you... I'll get my kidney back, old man! You have to sleep sometime!"
8814,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Gimme a hug."
8815,I don't need two kidneys. I have everything I need right here...
8816,Hmmm...
8817,"Yesss, tickling."
8818,"Well, I'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial."
8819,"Well, beats work."
8820,Are you sure this is the sci-fi convention? It's full of nerds.
8821,Nooooooooooo!
8822,You stupid nerds! He's trying to save you money on long distance!
8823,Neeerrrds!
8824,Get out of there!
8825,"Mr. Hamill, Mr. Mayor, come on!"
8826,Homer Simpson -- nerd buster. And I'm gettin' you out of here!
8827,Never!
8828,Follow me.
8829,"Oh, how was I supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?"
8830,Forget Maggie! She's gone!
8831,"Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted your ankle."
8832,Woo hoo!
8833,"I said, ""woo hoo."""
8834,Even during Ramadan?
8835,Wha?
8836,Nooo!
8837,Clear!
8838,The pig is in the poke.
8839,"Look out, Marge! Cat!"
8840,Hold it! What's your clearance?
8841,Access denied.
8842,They'll be fine in half an hour.
8843,"Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well..."
8844,"It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir."
8845,Semi-imported. Keep 'em comin'.
8846,"... And after Moe's, we went to Krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and I ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. And then Apu gave the Mayor lots of change for..."
8847,"Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time."
8848,"So, how'd you get the nickname ""Legs""?"
8849,"Oooh, mini-cannoli!"
8850,Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back here!
8851,Milking room? I hope you cows are decent.
8852,Oh! Crap on a crutch!
8853,They're milking rats! Milk-ing rats!
8854,"Bart, no!"
8855,"Oh, get that away from me!"
8856,"Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk. Ever."
8857,Go nuts.
8858,You... monster! How could you do that to the children?!
8859,"And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!"
8860,"Okay, we'll call it even."
8861,"Oh my God, I killed the mayor. All right, stay calm. I'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce, à la ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and..."
8862,His corpse is climbing the building!
8863,A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.
8864,"You're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. Now promise, or I'll let you fall to your death."
8865,Shake on it?
8866,"Relax, you're in good hands. Now come on, I'll pull you up."
8867,"Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad. Oh, what are you gonna do? Call your Godfather? Huh? Ooh, Godfather. Break it down!"
8868,"Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already out on bail. Well, I'm off to work."
8869,"It's my duty, Marge. Besides, those mobsters don't scare me. Bart, would you go start Daddy's car?"
8870,What? There's nothing to worry about.
8871,"All right, fine. I'll take a cab."
8872,"Oh, I get it. You're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?"
8873,"You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor. I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters."
8874,"Uh, excuse me..."
8875,Do you have a table for the mayor?
8876,Why do you talk that way?
8877,"Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name... Fat Tony?!"
8878,"All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quimby you're after--"
8879,"Mayor, Fat Tony asked me to give you this--"
8880,Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right.
8881,Nooooooooo!!!
8882,Potatoes are clean. The poison must be in the steak.
8883,"Yesss! Nobody messes with the mayor when Homer Simpson's on -- Aw, crap."
8884,"That guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?"
8885,"I think I saw him in ""Rent,"" or ""Stomp,"" or ""Clomp,"" or some piece of crap."
8886,Look out!
8887,Gimme that knife!
8888,The force?!
8889,Oh.
8890,"Oh, Fat Tony."
8891,"Ohh, I'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent."
8892,Really? Would you say I was magnetic?
8893,Aww...
8894,Get out of the way you--
8895,"Oh, I can explain that. You see..."
8896,"Don Rickles zinged you, Marge."
8897,"Eat my dust, dust!"
8898,"Aaah, what's the rush? Might rain next week."
8899,Really? You think I should get it washed?
8900,"Hey, that's great."
8901,Wuss rock?
8902,"Ten dollars?! What is this, a car wash for millionaires?"
8903,Hey! How did Churchy La Femme get half price?
8904,Senior citizen? Flanders?
8905,"Well, we'll see about that."
8906,"I wouldn't do that, Reverend. You see, ""Saint Flanders"" is as crooked as you or me!"
8907,"That's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. How, you ask? With a phony senior discount card!"
8908,Did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?
8909,Now I'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...
8910,But it seems to me that a senior citizen has to be over 55. Isn't that so?
8911,And you are how old?
8912,You mean that one with the red paint?
8913,"Geez, Flanders. You're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life."
8914,"All right, Bart!"
8915,Fire in the hole!
8916,"Okay, no more gasoline."
8917,Full power!
8918,"You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart!"
8919,"Well, well, well. So flawless Flanders needs help from stinky-pants Simpson."
8920,"Welly, welly, welly... Mr. Clean wants to hang with Dirty Dingus Magee."
8921,"Wellity, wellity, wellity..."
8922,Let's do it.
8923,"Eh, the Missus will clean that up."
8924,"First of all, I get five dollars a day plus expenses."
8925,"And I'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here."
8926,Well that's unfortunate. It really is.
8927,Congratulations! Welcome to the Homer Simpson Program.
8928,"One day soon I will come for you, and then the game will begin. Could be in the middle of the night. It could be when you least expect it. Or whatever's good for you. I don't care."
8929,Gimme that!
8930,That's your problem. You're living up here.
8931,You gotta live down here.
8932,"In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. Like this."
8933,We're going to break the bank at the Monty Burns Casino!
8934,You mean Lisa?
8935,"Oh yeah, right."
8936,Then we're goin' to Las Vegas! Which is actually back in that direction.
8937,"""Nobody's goin' to take my Ned / I'll teach him to have fu-un / Ooh, he's a Flanders machine..."""
8938,"Relax, I called her from the gas station."
8939,Sucker.
8940,I don't think so.
8941,I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
8942,Hey! Lance Murdock!
8943,"He's a daredevil, Ned. He laughs at death."
8944,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! Pick him!"
8945,"Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me?"
8946,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out. This isn't rocket science."
8947,Bo-ring.
8948,"Hey Flanders, Don't spill my beer!"
8949,"Okey-doke, let's hit the tables."
8950,"Oh, I think someone just had his first taste of blood loss."
8951,"Let's see... what's Marge's birthday? Barney is July fifteenth, same as Lassie's, so Marge's must be... fifty... oh, forget it. Flanders, what's your birthday?"
8952,"Seven, eh?"
8953,"Way to go, Flanders. The Bible's finally pulling its weight. Got any more holy numbers?"
8954,One betting disk please. Watch and learn.
8955,"Well, there you go. Now how 'bout a drink?"
8956,"Oh, that. That can be treated with our good friend alcohol. You might want to write that down. Where the hell's your notebook?"
8957,"Oh, never mind. Just pay attention."
8958,"Slave girl? Oh, slave girl?"
8959,Whuh?
8960,"Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please."
8961,"And for you, Ned?"
8962,Welcome to my world.
8963,The what now?
8964,"Well, of course a-- Who are you?"
8965,"Hey, smooth move, Flanders!"
8966,Eeech.
8967,"Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. Okay, you're saying that Ned and me married you two?"
8968,"Ned, no! Think of your wives!"
8969,"Wait a minute. This could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. We would remember if we got married."
8970,"Ahh, precious memories."
8971,What did you call me?
8972,"Sure. Sock it to me, baby."
8973,We are so dead.
8974,"Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. So breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. But first, I'm afraid we have some bad news. The waffle bar is closed. I'm sorry. I'm so very--"
8975,"But Ginger, honey, I am not the catch I appear to be."
8976,"Are you sure? Oh, rats. No offense, Sweetie."
8977,"Geez, I've never seen anyone so whipped so fast."
8978,"I don't know, Flanders, having two wives could have its advantages."
8979,"Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig. Chop, chop, dig, dig..."
8980,"I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping."
8981,"Ooh, a friendly bee."
8982,Ow!
8983,"Ow, that sting hurt so much. We gotta get outta this, Ned."
8984,"Blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. The program is rock solid. The program is sound."
8985,"Oh, those awful women want their omelettes."
8986,Ginger throws Ned a kiss.
8987,A lion!
8988,The Moody Blues!
8989,What if we switched wives? Would that help?
8990,Hel-lo. Our ticket to freedom.
8991,"So long, su--"
8992,"But Amber, I can change!"
8993,"All right, let's get our stories straight for Marge and Maude. We were out buying them fabulous gifts..."
8994,"Because we love them, Jackass."
8995,"Anyhoo, we came out of Walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships..."
8996,"You're right, you're right. Fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. They gang-probed you, while I discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved America."
8997,Would you rather tell Maude the truth?
8998,"Well, I only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you."
8999,"Hello, little birdie."
9000,Ah!! Cover your eyes!
9001,Boooo!
9002,"Oh, stupid Isotopes. Hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!"
9003,"Because, I loved them once and they broke my heart. Let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything."
9004,Especially me.
9005,I'm going to warm up the car.
9006,And it sucked!
9007,"""HITLER IS A JERK, MUSSOLINI..."""
9008,NOW IT DOESN'T WORK.
9009,"So, who won? The losers?"
9010,Losers.
9011,"You'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens."
9012,What's the hubub? Did Moe finally blow his brains out?
9013,Shut it off. They're losers.
9014,Championship?
9015,Wooooo! 'Topes ruuuule!
9016,"Oh, it's a great team, Kent... never gave up hope... I want to thank Jesus... and say hi to my special lady Marge... We did it, baby! Wooooo! Woooooo!"
9017,They lost? Those losers!
9018,Woo! Not over! Wooooo!
9019,Woo! Rumaki!
9020,Isotoooopes! Wooo!
9021,"Hey, a baseball field! Batter up!"
9022,Touchdown!
9023,Safe!
9024,Whoop! Careful.
9025,Last night?
9026,"Hello, big Maggie."
9027,Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time you'll think befo--
9028,"Oh, my God! Look what those rotten kids did to my car!"
9029,"That was cold-blooded, Marge."
9030,"Well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? Acting childish. Kidnapping. Child abuse..."
9031,"Not until you're older, son."
9032,"Kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! And they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! So-- Oh, right. Sorry."
9033,"Marge, kite."
9034,"So, Marge, ready for another episode of ""Don't Go There""?"
9035,"Okay, whatever takes my mind off my life."
9036,"Well, turn something on. I'm starting to think."
9037,Bo-ring. Go back to that infamy guy.
9038,I have a problem.
9039,"Well, at least they've already done me."
9040,"Oh, I hope they don't reveal this is a comb-over."
9041,"Speak for yourself! Bart, get down here! I'm gonna spank you back to the Stone Age!"
9042,Perfect.
9043,YEAH! / YOU'RE ONLY HERE 'CAUSE MARGE FORGOT HER PILL.
9044,Oh yeah? What can you old people do to us?
9045,Pfft. It wouldn't have made a difference.
9046,"Wow, a Val-U-Qual coupon book!"
9047,Let's see. Ten percent off carpet cleaning. Ten! Two pizzas for the price of one at Doughy's.
9048,"Yeah, but there's two!"
9049,"Oh, Marge. That's just a trick to get you in there so they can cure your foot pain."
9050,"See ya, kids. Me and my Val-U-Qual book are gonna paint the town red... with savings! I'll start with a couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson and I'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic."
9051,Do you like piña colonics / And getting caught in the rain...
9052,Passing out in the ocean...
9053,"Now this wheel balancing is free, right?"
9054,They won't?
9055,No.
9056,Really?
9057,"Oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?"
9058,"No! Wait! This is all my fault! Oh, if I could only turn back the clock and buy four new tires..."
9059,Six with the tip.
9060,Stem lube. Even I didn't fall for that... Although winter is coming...
9061,"Hey, I know you. We were in the same pyramid scheme."
9062,Yeah. I'm gettin' tired of them pointing and laughing at us.
9063,Football's so great.
9064,Me? Nah. Unless there's a coupon for it. Nah.
9065,Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?
9066,Me?!
9067,Sorry.
9068,"It's a deal. Hey, Moe. Wanna come with me and Wally to the Super Bowl?"
9069,"Yeah, they're good. But I wouldn't count out the... Denver Broncos ."
9070,"C'mon, Lenny. I just need four more guys to fill my Super Bowl bus. Whaddaya say?"
9071,C'mon!...
9072,C'mon!
9073,"Oh, c'mon!..."
9074,"Yes! Now that Lenny's in, Carl will fall like a domino."
9075,"Yeah, yeah. Do we have any pencils that work?"
9076,"Yeah, it's a good group."
9077,"Aw, thank God! Now we can stop holding it in."
9078,"What is it, Rudy?"
9079,"Hey, Troy Aikman!"
9080,"'Scuse me, comin' through. Friends of Dan Marino."
9081,"Okay, Dan. Fire away."
9082,Woo hoo! Homer Simpson with the pick!
9083,"Uh-oh. Lateral, to Bart!"
9084,My spine.
9085,"Scalping tickets to the Super Bowl. Have you no shame, sir? I should give you a royal caning."
9086,"Aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. Wally and I have all the tickets we need."
9087,Stop eating our tickets!
9088,"Yes, if by ""crestfallen"" you mean ""kill us."" Listen, let me talk to them. Maybe I can smooth this over."
9089,My friends...
9090,"Please, my friends... Ow! All right, I'll get you into to the game!"
9091,"Excuse me, Uh, Mr. Scalper, sir. Have I told you that I love you?"
9092,"Okay, Moe. I believe you had me by the throat. Reverend Lovejoy was working the body..."
9093,"Gentlemen, I have an idea."
9094,Run!
9095,Woo hoo!
9096,We can still make the kickoff!
9097,Let us outta here!
9098,"Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, cleaning lady. Would you let us out of here?"
9099,I didn't ask for your life story. Just give me the key.
9100,"Man, that's gonna be some show."
9101,Football!
9102,You guys are following me? I was following Flanders.
9103,In a minute.
9104,"Hey, it's the beer copter!"
9105,"Hit the road, Gramps. This is a private sky box."
9106,The game! We're so close!
9107,"Follow me, boys. We're finally going to the Sup... Ow!"
9108,Y'ello...
9109,"Hey, howyadoin'?"
9110,"Well, it's about time."
9111,"Ow! Oh! All right, Lovejoy! You're gonna get it."
9112,But this might be my last chance to win one.
9113,"Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't."
9114,What one?
9115,Door?
9116,Phone?
9117,"Dog, cat?"
9118,"Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place."
9119,You're thinking of all the other years. This year's shows are classics.
9120,"There's ""The Laughter Family."" That's animated. Networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat."
9121,"Gee... I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kinda stupid. Hey, ""PoliceCops."" That sounds like a lethal combination."
9122,Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.
9123,This is better.
9124,He's named like my name!
9125,Wow. They've captured my personality perfectly. Did you see the way Daddy caught that bullet?
9126,"Don't confuse Daddy, Lisa."
9127,"Y'ello... yes, this is the original Homer Simpson. Who's this?... The Debbie Pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... Yes, I'm still available."
9128,"Marge, that was Debbie Pinson. DEB-BIE PIN-SON."
9129,Local Man Has Same Name. A TV character has the same name as Springfield resident Homer Simpson.
9130,And that's the end of that chapter.
9131,All right. And what's the name?
9132,Take it or leave it... Carl.
9133,"Mmm, who knows? Maybe I'll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference."
9134,Yup. Right down to the scarf.
9135,"Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Simpson. He's fat and stupid."
9136,"No, no, he can't be. I know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. Yeah, that's gotta be it."
9137,Shutup! I'm not your clown! Don't diminish me!
9138,"Gentlemen, I bid you--"
9139,Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa! Who-o-oa!
9140,I can't understand what happened. Why did they change Homer Simpson's character from cool to stupid?
9141,That does it! There's only one thing I can do.
9142,I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
9143,"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. Now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about..."
9144,"People are laughing at me, Marge. Let's get outta here. Forget the baby's medicine."
9145,"Fine. I'll be in the car, driving home."
9146,"Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's."
9147,"C'mon, people. Enough is enough."
9148,Okay.
9149,"The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!"
9150,And that big yellow flower.
9151,"Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there."
9152,"Yeah. ""Bart."""
9153,"Uh, so, I just want to know how come you made your Homer Simpson character so..."
9154,It better have.
9155,Who's Jeremy Piven?
9156,PoliceCops.
9157,"Yeah, but why does the Homer Simpson character have to be so stupid?"
9158,I'm begging you. I'm a human being. Let me have my dignity back.
9159,"Your honor, I'd like to sue the producers of ""PoliceCops"" for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name."
9160,Then I'd like to legally change my name.
9161,Any of these will be fine.
9162,"Dynamic, isn't it?"
9163,"That's the way Max Power is, Marge. Decisive, uncompromising, and rude."
9164,"Yes, briefly."
9165,"Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off."
9166,Nobody snuggles with Max Power. You strap yourself in and feel the G's.
9167,"And it doesn't stop in the bedroom. Oh no, I'm taking charge. Kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way."
9168,"Yeah, but faster."
9169,"MAX POWER / HE'S THE MAN / WHOSE NAME YOU'D LOVE TO TOUCH / BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH / HIS NAME SOUNDS GOOD IN YOUR EAR / BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT, YOU MUSTN'T FEAR / 'CAUSE HIS NAME CAN BE SAID BY ANYONE..."
9170,You remembered my name!
9171,Mr. Power.
9172,So I want the monogram to read M-A-X P-O-W-
9173,"Max Power doesn't abbreviate. Each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. Maybe more important. No, as important."
9174,"And if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag."
9175,Just takin' care of business.
9176,"Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power."
9177,"Yeah, isn't it? I got it off a hair dryer."
9178,"Yeah, but I usually have three or four."
9179,Tie good. You like shirt?
9180,"Marge, this is Thai food. From now on, I want it morning, noon and night."
9181,When Trent Steel bought me some.
9182,He's Max Power's oldest and dearest friend.
9183,"Oh, I spit my gum in there."
9184,"No way, this guy's a winner. He has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... Anyway, you wouldn't understand."
9185,For all of us. Look.
9186,"This is our chance to rub elbows with Springfield's young, hip power couples... Like me and Debbie Pinson."
9187,"Get used to it, honey. From now on, we'll be spelling everything with letters."
9188,Nah. Just park it.
9189,And I counted the pennies in the ashtray.
9190,Maarrge... President Clinton!
9191,"Me, too. Let's sing the Cinderella song."
9192,Uh-oh. Here comes Lorne Michaels. Pretend you don't see him.
9193,"Anyway, Marge. Uh, how do you feel about the economy?"
9194,"So I said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come I can't eat the walls?"""
9195,"Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch..."
9196,"Hey, no problem."
9197,"Woo, privilege!"
9198,Whuh?!
9199,Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!
9200,Somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
9201,"Hey, stop shoving! I'm Max Power!"
9202,"What's going on, Trent? Where are you taking me?"
9203,"Oh, this is the worst party ever."
9204,"Oh, Marge. I thought it would be fun to be on Springfield's ""A"" list, but these people are nuts."
9205,Sure you can. Buncha no-good do-gooders.
9206,"That's what I'm saying! See Marge, this guy gets it."
9207,Tree-huggers...
9208,"No, I just thought it was cute when you called him..."
9209,I can't lose them!
9210,Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!
9211,I'm free! Woo hoo!
9212,Right after Happy Hour!
9213,"So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?"
9214,What?
9215,"Yes, I learned you've gotta be yourself. G'night, honey."
9216,"Oh, I almost forgot. While I was at the courthouse, I had them change your name."
9217,Chesty LaRue.
9218,"Just try it for two weeks. If you're not completely satisfied, you can be Busty St. Claire."
9219,Fine. Hooty McBoob it is.
9220,"Sleep tight, Hooty."
9221,"And then the handsome prince realized he had to go to the bathroom really bad. But the evil ogre, Barney, had left the men's room in the most wicked condition. So the prince went out back to the enchanted alley..."
9222,"Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon..."
9223,"I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili!"
9224,"Hmm, what's an ""eltdown?"" Eh."
9225,Door's unlocked.
9226,"Oh, don't make me choose."
9227,"Yeah, I'm going right to the top."
9228,"Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word."
9229,"I'm picking it up. ""Sala"" seems to mean jerk. And I think ""Manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."
9230,"Oh, they're newlyweds. They'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'."
9231,"Hey, they stole our idea! See, look!"
9232,"""I Cherish You, My Precious."" Mm, nah. ""To a heckuva blacksmith."" Nah, I already got him one."
9233,"""You're A-peeling. Let's Never Split."" That's funny 'cause they're monkeys. So long, rejects."
9234,"Mornin', Apu. Still in hot water with the squaw?"
9235,"Oh, she's not gonna leave you right before Valentine's Day. That'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash."
9236,Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.
9237,"C'mon, boy. C'mon!"
9238,"Goood dog! Good doggie! ""Tax Hike Approved""? Bad dog. Bad, bad dog."
9239,Now to trim away the fat.
9240,"Outlook. ""Vista."" No. ""Spotlight."" ""Mosaic."" Nah."
9241,"Oh, sorry, Marge, that's in my stockpile. You can have this."
9242,Gimme that!
9243,"Well, don't just gasp, read it."
9244,I used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
9245,"We sold it, didn't we?"
9246,"Yeah, I hate that song."
9247,"Don't worry, honey. I got something really special planned for Valentine's Day."
9248,Wouldn't you like to know?
9249,Everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. See the problem's communication. Too much communication.
9250,"But Marge, it's worth it. Look, the Taco Bell dog. Yo quiero Ta... Hey, where'd it go? Here boy!"
9251,This Valentine's crap has gone too far.
9252,"And ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?"
9253,"Will you stop it?! It's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame Apu. He's makin' us look bad!"
9254,We've gotta stop that traitor Apu.
9255,"C'mon, Apu. Make your move."
9256,I'unno. Gasoline? Axes? I got some stuff in the trunk.
9257,Let's roll.
9258,"Not yet, I'm not. You'll know when I'm driving. And it'll..."
9259,Only till eleven.
9260,Not entirely.
9261,"Oh, baby. We got him now. There's no escape from the airport."
9262,"Hey, look! It's Elton John!"
9263,Not if I can help it. And help it I might.
9264,Mr. John. I'm your biggest fan. I've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.
9265,Uhhhh.
9266,"Sir Elton, my noble friends and I would like to dub you a Knight of the... Grand Concourse."
9267,How the hell should I know? Just get in this cage.
9268,"Not so fast, Apu!"
9269,"We're putting an end to your insane Valentine's rampage. Never again will good, lazy men have to... What the--?"
9270,Oh no you don't!
9271,"Hey, you with the scarf! Stop skywriting!"
9272,I am so sick of that damn code!
9273,"If you won't stop, then I'll stop you!"
9274,Lousy message.
9275,Correction. Kill us both.
9276,Ow! Prickers! Owwww!
9277,Roses. So many roses.
9278,Roses.
9279,"Well, I think I have a collapsed lung, but okay!"
9280,"Oh, no let me out! Let's get outta here!"
9281,You drive. I eat.
9282,I saw Krabappel's butt. I paid.
9283,"C'mon, Mom / Flanders, woman!"
9284,"Ohhh, you suck, Marge."
9285,"Wow. Did you see that thing, Marge? So powerful. So commanding. So forceful and raw. It didn't ask, it just took."
9286,Canyonero...
9287,"Hey, a red one! Can I buy that? Please?"
9288,Will do!
9289,"And that's it, right?"
9290,"But that's not for awhile, right?"
9291,Sweet...
9292,Huh?
9293,"Aw, crap! It's a girl's car. I can't drive this."
9294,Shut up! Screw you guys!
9295,Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work.
9296,"Are you saying I'm gay? Because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it."
9297,Fine.
9298,Sucker.
9299,"A three-chambered peanut! Marge, look what I did! Come quick! Hurry! Marge?"
9300,"Marge, you've been out there all morning."
9301,So... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.
9302,"Aw, please come in. Maggie smells bad. And the cat wants something, but I don't know what."
9303,"Well, that's a turn-off."
9304,At least I've got a license.
9305,"C'mon, kids, I went too far."
9306,I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.
9307,I don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.
9308,"Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal."
9309,I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm just gonna wake him up.
9310,"Uh-oh. Here's your slingshot, Lisa."
9311,"Don't worry, kids. I know just what to do. Jumanji! Does anything from the movies actually work?"
9312,"Back! Back, I say!"
9313,Oh no. I'm out of popcorn.
9314,You throw your peanuts!
9315,"Ohhh, when will Detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?"
9316,Marge!
9317,"Oh, thank you, God. And thank you Porta-John. You really saved my..."
9318,Who's out there?!
9319,"Oh, I'm gonna die! Jesus, Allah, Buddha, I love you all!"
9320,Nice rhino.
9321,"Oh, no! She's not gonna make it!"
9322,"Ah, give me a minute..."
9323,"Oh, Marge, you saved me!"
9324,Is there anything that guy doesn't know?
9325,"Oh, I'm sure of it!"
9326,"I'd like to read the following statement, but I do so under my own free will. It has come to my attention that NBC sucks. I apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many FOX shows as possible. So in summary, NBC bad, FOX good. CBS great."
9327,"19-- 1939?! Oh my God, I've gone back in time!"
9328,I've got to warn everybody about Hitler! And get to the ice cream store!
9329,Shut up! You haven't even been born yet.
9330,"Oh boy, am I glad to see you guys."
9331,Woo hoo! Let's party!
9332,That's no way to address Sir Drinks-A-Lot.
9333,Okay.
9334,"Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?"
9335,"Well, Marge?"
9336,What's your favorite radio station?
9337,"Hey, that's super! See you later."
9338,"Yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad."
9339,They know I'm kidding.
9340,"Okay, Bart, it's your turn to pick. Where are we headed? Bowling? Demolition derby? P.J. O'Harrigans? Isn't that a funny name? Huh? Huh?"
9341,"We did a Lisa thing last month. And I'm glad we did, but now I think we should do something normal people would like."
9342,"Go ahead, sweetie."
9343,"Oh, no! Ho, ho. I'm not falling for that again. If it doesn't have Siamese twins in a jar, it's not a fair."
9344,We're gonna go see Marmaduke?
9345,What? And Marmaduke doesn't?
9346,"This is all your fault for trading away your turn. Just for that, no dessert tonight!"
9347,Good ol' government.
9348,Thank God for grave robbers.
9349,Fonzie's jacket!
9350,Who's Fonzie?! Don't they teach you anything in school? He freed the squares.
9351,Where? I don't see that.
9352,Relax. I'm just boning up on the ol' Constitution.
9353,I didn't mean to! Look!
9354,Wha?!
9355,"Finally, a company that understands my needs."
9356,So we're even then?
9357,"It's called caring, Marge."
9358,"Ya gotta admit, Marge, that's a lot more roaming."
9359,"Hey, this is pretty comfortable. That Andy Capp was onto something."
9360,"Just pretend it's a tree, honey. Or as we say at OmniTouch, a Progress Tree."
9361,Wha?! I heard a yell. Did you touch a wire?
9362,"Nothing. They just needed a place to put all the electronic gizmos, and I know how much you like that sciencey stuff so I..."
9363,"Come on, Lisa, try and see this from the OmniTouch Corporation's point of view."
9364,Hm. That thought never occurred to me. Funny how your mind works in a crisis.
9365,"Lisa, what's your favorite movie?"
9366,"That's right, ""The Odd Couple."" So meet your comically mismatched roommate, Bart Simpson."
9367,"Ooh, anything spicy?"
9368,Great. I'm gonna eat mayonnaise!
9369,"Well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack, Jack and Jill, Fred and Ethel, the Three..."
9370,"Bart, stop squeaking your chair!"
9371,"If you've got to do something, click this pen."
9372,"Hey, that looks like fun."
9373,"You're on! Lisa, you play winner."
9374,"Oh, honey, you missed a great race. Bart was winning, but then he said ""this is stupid"" and he stopped, and I won!"
9375,"Hey, you're mad at me. That wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?"
9376,Maybe you'd feel better if we watched some TV together.
9377,No it's not.
9378,"Oooh, here's something you'd like. ""When Animals Attack Magicians."""
9379,Awful entertaining.
9380,Somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.
9381,Yes it is.
9382,Great. Maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.
9383,"Well, that's a relief."
9384,"Give it a try, honey."
9385,"It's true. I'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em."
9386,"Oh, no you don't. Screw that touchy, queery crap! We'll take the harsh antacids. Nothing's too good for my little girl."
9387,I sure settled his hash. Imagine that quack thinking you'd try one of those crazy New-Age cures.
9388,"Sure they are, honey."
9389,"I'm sorry, Lisa. Oh, it's not your fault. I know we love each other, Dad, but we're two very different people. And, much as I hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart."
9390,"Oh Lisa, honey, I won't ever let that happen."
9391,"Nah, you must be thinking of your mother. I'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... Can't we just go in?"
9392,"Oh good, I've been meaning to buy a ""Dream Catcher?"" Gimme a break."
9393,"Other cultures are fine. I'm just saying I can get along in life without a ""tooth brush."""
9394,And a ooga-booga to you too.
9395,Absolutely not. My little girl's tummy hurts. Do you have anything to stop her complaining?
9396,"Let's try some oil of Lorenzo. And, uh, what's keeping Joan Rivers alive?"
9397,Oh no. No freezing.
9398,Can you pee in it?
9399,Me too.
9400,"Oh, my."
9401,OOH EEE OOH AH AH / TING TANG WALLA WALLA BING BANG / OOH EEE OOH AH AH / WALLA BING BANG TING TING TOOO!
9402,"Heyyy, this piece of junk is finally doing something."
9403,Oh yeah... art.
9404,Woo! Sensory deprivation kicks ass.
9405,"Okay, I'm ready to get out now... Yoo hoo! Hippie lady! Hippie lady?! Hey! Hippie lady!"
9406,Whoa! What's going on? Ow! Oh! This inner peace stuff is tough on the old coconut.
9407,Hippie Lady I wanna get out.
9408,I told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. Bom-bom-bom-bom... I told the witch doctor he had to run a test...
9409,Hi sweetie.
9410,I went on a wild ride without ever leaving the building. How was yours?
9411,Like what?
9412,"Whoa, look at that car burn! Does it get any better than this?"
9413,"So I said to that nurse, ""You can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."""
9414,You better believe I did.
9415,"Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see..."
9416,Must eat beef... must defeat guy I just met...
9417,Wait. There's a place like that in Springfield?! Then why are we eating this crap?
9418,"C'mon, everybody, we're going to the Slaughterhouse!"
9419,Didn't I?
9420,Wow. It's even more wonderful than Lisa said!
9421,"Wait a minute. Is this the biggest steak you've got? 72 ounces? I thought this was supposed to be a steakhouse, not a little... girly... underpantsy... pink doily... tea party place."
9422,"Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs."
9423,They like me because I'm brave.
9424,Oh yeah? What do you know about it? Y--
9425,It's you! You're him! You're Tony Randall!
9426,Greenhorns! Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn?
9427,"Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly..."
9428,"Huh? Oh, right. The steak."
9429,So much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...
9430,Lousy drunks. I'll show them.
9431,What's happening to me? There's still food... but I don't want to eat it. I've become everything I've ever hated.
9432,"My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe?"
9433,"He called me ""Greenhorn."" I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had."
9434,"Oh yes he will! And on time, too!"
9435,"I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer."
9436,Don't you have school?
9437,"Ah, touché."
9438,"Bye, Marge!"
9439,Aren't you gonna say bye?
9440,That didn't sound like you meant it.
9441,"That's more like it. So long, suckers!"
9442,Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now I'm gettin' the hang of this thing. I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before.
9443,"Oh, yeah? My left arm says different."
9444,Piece o' cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.
9445,Ohhh.
9446,That little punk.
9447,"Sure thing, Gwenn."
9448,"Aww... that's a nice, friendly gal."
9449,Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day.
9450,"Great. I'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwenn my wife."
9451,For now...
9452,It ate everybody.
9453,Stupid!
9454,I bet ol' Red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.
9455,"Relax, boy. We're ahead of schedule."
9456,Ten hours?! We gotta roll!
9457,"Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long."
9458,Sold!
9459,No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
9460,Okay-We're-All-Set-Let's-Put-The-Pedal-To-The-Metal!
9461,"I whole-heartedly-agree. Oh-man-I'm-really-wired. This-is-a-big-mistake-I-can... Ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. So drowsy. Pep-pills-perking-up-again. I-could-drive allll Niiight..."
9462,I fell asleep at the wheel! But we didn't crash. It's a miracle!
9463,You'll never believe what happened. I fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.
9464,The what now?
9465,The trucks drive themselves?
9466,"Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often."
9467,"Wow! You guys are even lazier than me! Well, don't worry. I'll keep your secret."
9468,"Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady."
9469,"The second I let go of the wheel, this little wonder kicks in."
9470,"And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this!"
9471,"C'mon out, boy. It's windy."
9472,"Relax, everybody! The Navitron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me! But keep it a secret! It's a big scam! Okay?"
9473,"Look, son. It's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy."
9474,"Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity."
9475,"Thank you sir, may I have another?"
9476,"Oh, why do all my trips end like this?"
9477,"Eat water, good buddy."
9478,"I think we lost 'em, Bart."
9479,"Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy."
9480,All right.
9481,I'm keeping a promise to an American roadmaster.
9482,"Red. The trucker. Big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?"
9483,We'll get past that barrier somehow. Ol' Blinky here will find a way.
9484,"I'm not Red, I'm Homer."
9485,Woo hoo!
9486,"Ten-four, dead buddy."
9487,"This is Red Barclay's shipment. On time, as always."
9488,"Well... the last time I saw him, he was in a big plastic bag."
9489,"Well, son. I guess it's time to go home."
9490,"No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide."
9491,Thank you.
9492,"Oh, man. This is the hottest Easter ever."
9493,"Relax, I found it in the dumpster."
9494,Heads up!
9495,"Well, hel-lo!"
9496,"'Course not. There's no pain in the Garden of Eden. Hey, you must be Eve."
9497,Looks like God made you out of my sexiest rib.
9498,Is there!
9499,Don't mind if I do!
9500,"Uh, good morning, Lord. I just have to, ah, compliment you on this beautifully crafted mate."
9501,"No, you're too kind. And wise, and righteous... I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend."
9502,"No problem, Lord. And it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if I had a few extra wives."
9503,Just sayin'...
9504,"Sorry, I already gave him a name. ""Land monster."""
9505,Branch monster.
9506,Why won't you be art?!
9507,You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.
9508,And you keep saying we need to do things together...
9509,"Uh, um, uh... I think we should see other people?"
9510,Usually a mink massage makes me feel better. But something's missing now.
9511,I didn't say stop.
9512,"Yeah, just like yesterday."
9513,"I gave a rib to Eve, and now she's gone forever."
9514,"Oh, poor Eve. What are you doing out there in that horrible place?"
9515,"This is my fault. I shoulda stood up for you during that whole ""Applegate"" thing."
9516,"Don't say that! Maybe I can sneak you back in. I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right?"
9517,"C'mon, Eve. Hurry!"
9518,"Ohhh, my dear, sweet Eve. I love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the porno bush."
9519,"Oh, there, there, I'm sure he's gone to a better place, Lord."
9520,"Hey, now let's not do anything rash... God is love, right?"
9521,"Ohhh, my back. So this must be that pain thing."
9522,"Oh, yeah. Definitely pain!"
9523,This sucks. Things were so much better back in the Garden.
9524,The pie shall be cut in two. Then each man shall receive... death. I'll eat the pie.
9525,"Eh, it's not the end of the world."
9526,I never used those pizza coupons.
9527,"Where do you think you're going, Missy?"
9528,"Ooh, I smell barbecue!"
9529,"Hey, look! Oh, they're out of hot dogs! And the cole slaw has pineapple in it! German potato salad!"
9530,You put da beer in da coconut and drink it all up / You put da beer in da coconut and throw da can away...
9531,You throw da can away...
9532,You throw da can away...
9533,"Marge, I'm out of beer."
9534,"But, Marge, I'm not like other men. That's why you buy my pants at that special store."
9535,"Fine. I'll drop everything I'm doing just for you. But you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my Saturday. Can you live with that, Marge? Huh? Can ya?"
9536,Can you?
9537,"'Scuse me, I have a few questions for Pop."
9538,"Look Pop, I'm planning some expert home repairs, and I need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox."
9539,I'd like to return this barbecue kit.
9540,A man in an apron!
9541,"No, no, I'm into chicken."
9542,Mmmm... hippo...
9543,"How 'bout it, Bart? Would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?"
9544,We can all burn evidence in it.
9545,"There, that wasn't so hard... was it, honey?"
9546,"Okay, sweetie. Daddy'll take over."
9547,"Oh, yeah. That's a fine looking..."
9548,"Okay, no big deal..."
9549,Stupid Lisa.
9550,You gotta build fast! Cement drying!
9551,"All right, let's see..."
9552,"English side ruined! Must use French instructions! ""Le grille?"" What the hell is that?!"
9553,Come on... fit you...
9554,"Yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... Why doesn't mine look like that?!"
9555,Why?! Why must life be so hard? Why must I fail in every attempt at masonry?
9556,"Well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here."
9557,"Come on, you..."
9558,"Well, of course. Any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. It teaches them while they learn."
9559,"But, but..."
9560,I'll never get rid of it. It'll follow me to the ends of the Earth!
9561,All right! My bumper fell off!
9562,Not my fault! Act of God! Act of God!
9563,Uh-oh.
9564,Shaving my shoulders / I'm gettin' it all shaved off...
9565,Take the kids out back.
9566,I'll handle this.
9567,Oh yeah? Prove it.
9568,"Uh... All right! Just go ahead and sue me. Everybody else does! The average settlement is $68,000."
9569,You mean this hunka junk? This isn't art. Just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. Didn't you? Didn't you?! You stupid so...
9570,"Oh, I got that, lady."
9571,This lady says I'm an artist.
9572,"In high school I was voted ""Most Likely to be a Mental Patient, Hillbilly, or Chimpanzee!"""
9573,So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it...
9574,"Lisa, all great artists love free food. Check out Jasper Johns."
9575,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge, my first sale! In your face, Jasper Johns!"
9576,"I'm gonna be an outsider artist! That way, I can turn all these old baseball cards, Disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable."
9577,"Hey, I've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when I painted portrait after portrait of Ringo Starr."
9578,"I think I remember my own life, Marge."
9579,"Astrid said the key to my art is anger. But you know me, I'm Mister Mellow."
9580,"So I'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. C'mon, gimme what you got."
9581,"Good work, honey. Keep it comin'."
9582,"Moe, this is Astrid, my ""dealer."" And these are my fans, Gunter, Kyoto, and Cecil Hampstead-on-Cecil-Cecil."
9583,"What do we owe you, Moe?"
9584,All right.
9585,Is it about pies?
9586,"Wow. It's like Marge's dream come true... for me! Isn't that great, Marge?! For me!"
9587,"Look Marge, they're advertising my show in ""Art in America."" It's the first time I've been mentioned there, that I know of."
9588,Good night.
9589,You're upset about something. Is this about that trip Barney and I took to Machu Picchu?
9590,"Aw, honey, I've always liked your art. Your paintings look like the things they look like."
9591,"Frankly, I'd be a little turned on."
9592,"Marge, I've screwed up everything I've ever done. I mean, look at Bart. But I finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. And that feels pretty good."
9593,Now you're making sense. Good night.
9594,"I give you ""Botched Hibachi."" The tricycle is on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection."
9595,"This piece I call ""Failed Shelving Unit with Stupid Stuck Chainsaw and Applesauce."""
9596,"And finally, my thing de resistance, ""Attempted Birdhouse I."""
9597,"Shall we start the bidding at, say, ten thousand dollars?"
9598,"All right, how about a million?"
9599,What's going on here? You weirdos love this stuff.
9600,"Wait! Come back! I'm a God to you! Worship me -- or fear my wrath! Please fear my wrath, please... Call me."
9601,I don't get it. Why don't people like my art anymore?
9602,"Hey, Ray J. Johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been."
9603,You can call him Ray / Or you can call him J. / Or you can call him Ray J. / But you doesn't have to call him...
9604,Matt Groening? What's he doing in a museum? He can barely draw.
9605,"Ow! Oh no, I'm being erased!"
9606,He must be a hundred feet tall.
9607,It's glorious! The streets are paved with water. You could ride a walrus to work!
9608,"Mmmm, split-pea."
9609,With ham!
9610,"No, these guys are geniuses. I could never think of something like soup or a pencil."
9611,I'm just gonna rest for a minute.
9612,What the?! Who the?! Hey!
9613,Ow! Ah! No! Ow! Ow! Hey! Ow! Ow! You're mean.
9614,Eww...
9615,Ow! Hey! No! No! Ow! N-No! Ow!
9616,"No, no, Andy, no!"
9617,Marge! Why does Art hate me? I never did anything to Art.
9618,"Oh, let's get out of here."
9619,Is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
9620,Not the Reichstag!
9621,Why'd he do that?
9622,Killer umbrellas? Of course. Exquisite.
9623,"Big? Daring? Lisa, that's it! I've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. Step one: steal all the doormats in town."
9624,"Adios, ""Casa de Flanders."""
9625,"So long, The Simpsons!"
9626,Step two: snorkel the animals.
9627,Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions.
9628,Make sure you strap 'em on real tight.
9629,"Now, step three..."
9630,"That's for the courts to decide, son."
9631,"Wake up! Wake up, Springfield!"
9632,I've got a surprise for youuu!
9633,"People of Springfield, behold my latest work!"
9634,It's conceptual art -- the Grand Canals of Springfield. Just like Venice without the black plague. What do you think?
9635,"No, I'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. You'll always be the artist in the family."
9636,Is that our house?
9637,And is that us on the roof?
9638,Are we kissing?
9639,A mascot contest?! I'm sure to win that. Unless one of you jinxes me.
9640,"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
9641,"Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is! Meet Abby the Olympic Tabby."
9642,"Just for the prototype, honey."
9643,"Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup. How about a big Olympic hello for Springy, the Springfield Spring!"
9644,It's fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.
9645,God bless America!
9646,"They picked Springy! In your face, Patty and Selma!"
9647,I've never wanted a beer worse in my life.
9648,"I love you, honey."
9649,"To you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover."
9650,He says what we're all thinking.
9651,"Lucky stiff. I'm working my ass off here. Good steak, honey."
9652,I'llgetit.
9653,Woo hoo! My springs! They finally came!
9654,"Yeah, but I should have no problem selling a thousand springs."
9655,"Idiots! Ooh, these are fun!"
9656,"Hello, little girl, is your mommy home? You'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy Mr. Bouncy Best-Friend."
9657,"Boy, Lenny, you sure look hungry. Have some nuts."
9658,"Now if you want to be the life of the party like Lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item."
9659,"Boy, Moe, you sure look angry. Here, have some nuts."
9660,"Welcome to the Kitchen of Tomorrow today! Marge, how much would you pay for a self-flipping hamburger pan?"
9661,"Don't answer yet. Watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of God's greatest creation, the spring."
9662,"Now, watch this..."
9663,Ow! Ohhh...
9664,"Some second degree burns, but some first class burgers."
9665,But you haven't seen the Baby of Tomorrow! Ta-daa!
9666,"Now if I drop her, no more tears."
9667,"""D"" it up, Marge. I'm goin' to the hole."
9668,You flush one down / It swirls around / Nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down...
9669,"Of course not! ""Nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / Nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."""
9670,A hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. A hundred and thirty-five springs...
9671,And I do! Woo!
9672,"Oh, we stopped those when the kids said I was too fat to carry."
9673,Can't we go home yet? My feet hurt. All this fresh air is making my hair move. And I don't know how much longer I can complain.
9674,"Could we, Marge? Could we get a horse?"
9675,There are some dogs. We could all ride dogs.
9676,"Pew, well, I dodged a bullet."
9677,Clown.
9678,"Thanks, Noodles."
9679,"Hey, it's not just a store. It's a ""mega"" store. ""Mega"" means ""good."" And ""store"" means ""thing."""
9680,"Wow, what a high-tech wonderland. Oop, got an itch."
9681,"Yeah, they're not great."
9682,I DO!
9683,I don't know. Just give me the dollar.
9684,I do!
9685,I do.
9686,Easy... easyyy...
9687,"Woo hoo! Look at me, I can juggle!"
9688,"I see. Well, I'll need some beer."
9689,"Oh, Arthur Fortune!"
9690,"Well, you don't have to call me slovenly."
9691,"Well, how 'bout donating money to charity? Lots of crazy old coots do that."
9692,Can do.
9693,"Wait a minute... because I brought the check, they named a wing after me? Oh, you must be mad."
9694,"Gee, I feel bad. If people knew the real Monty Burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you."
9695,"Good luck, Mr. Burns. And if you get in trouble, I wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people."
9696,"You see white people have names like ""Lenny,"" whereas, black people have names like ""Carl."""
9697,Good thing those lesbians knew CPR.
9698,"Ooo, Arthur Fortune. You know what that fabulous man just did? He gave the Springfield zoo two male Pandas, and got them to mate successfully."
9699,"Oh, yeah! And I'm not easily impressed. Wow! A blue car!"
9700,A sober Irishman?
9701,"Whew, that was one long helicopter ride."
9702,"Do you really think you can capture the Loch Ness Monster? I mean, he's eluded Leonard Nimoy and Peter Graves."
9703,"Hey, Willie. That old couple looks just like you."
9704,Good. Good. One more.
9705,"Uh, to work in your power plant?"
9706,Check.
9707,Tilt? You monster!
9708,"Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. Besides, I'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!"
9709,Can you believe I'm a size four? Woo!
9710,No way! Aberdeen rules!
9711,God! It's him!
9712,"Well, if you wanted people to love you, you sure blew it with that insane rampage."
9713,"But you know what? To be loved you have to be nice to people. Every day! But, to be hated, you don't have to do squat."
9714,"So what do we do with our friend here? Uh, throw him in the dumpster?"
9715,"Come on, Nessie. One more pull."
9716,"Okay, okay... You want a shrimp cocktail?"
9717,Shuuuut uppa you mouth.
9718,"All right, a gross-out contest! Grandma Plopwell, you've done it again."
9719,I'm hot buttered / Check it and see / I got a fever of four fifty-three...
9720,I'm hot... so very hot...
9721,Fours?
9722,Ow! Ow! Oh!
9723,Judges can't win the contest! Booooo!
9724,Take that!
9725,"Look, I got runner-up prize."
9726,No. But I got it.
9727,Stealing is wrong.
9728,Free Boudoir Photography. Sweet.
9729,Hm...
9730,"Oh, right."
9731,"Yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale."
9732,"Hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. I'm gonna read it just as soon as I finish what I'm doing here."
9733,I envy them.
9734,"Hello, I have a certificate for a free erotic photo session."
9735,Uh... Geraldo... Simpson.
9736,Who told you?
9737,"Uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?"
9738,"Well, I don't, but the Block Association seems to. They wanted a ""traditional"" Santa Claus."
9739,"Oh, that's great, honey. You tell me everything you can before the commercial's over."
9740,Up-bup-bup-bup.
9741,Are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?
9742,Please be kind.
9743,Now you're sure this will save my marriage?
9744,Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!
9745,"Okay, I think he's gone."
9746,Let's reschedule.
9747,"Gee, you said you were gonna to make me look sexier, but it's awfully dark in here."
9748,It's time to get Homer-erotic.
9749,"Maarge. Oh, Maaarge."
9750,I've got something for you.
9751,"Houston, we have a problem. A sexy problem."
9752,Grrr. I'm gonna to maul you.
9753,"No, no. It's just our basement."
9754,"Yeah, so? Come on! More kissing!"
9755,But I was gonna score...
9756,Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!
9757,"Now's our opening. Come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town!"
9758,Did you have fun with your robot buddy?
9759,I am.
9760,Wow. I can't believe someone I never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.
9761,"Yes, I did."
9762,Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!
9763,"Hey, why didn't you tell me the new issue of ""Weird"" was here?! I love their hilarious send-ups of hit movies."
9764,"""Gigabytes!"" They've done it again. Gigabytes. Wait, this isn't ""Weird."" Why, there's no magazine called ""Weird,"" is there?"
9765,The Internet? Is that thing still around?
9766,"Come on, Lisa! Monkeys!"
9767,"Oh yeah. I'm betting on Jai-Alai in the Cayman Islands, I invested in something called News Corp..."
9768,Ahh! Undo! Undo! Uhh.
9769,"Well, let's check the old bank account."
9770,See? Even after all my cyber-squandering we've still got twelve hundred dollars.
9771,"You seem to know an awful lot about this for an ""innocent person."""
9772,"Ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, I'll get us the money. Even if I have to get a second job."
9773,"Yes, sir."
9774,"I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir."
9775,"It's just that you and Maude live like royalty in your fancy castle, while I got Marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive."
9776,They're years ahead of us.
9777,"Well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine..."
9778,Sweet.
9779,Go on...
9780,"Maybe you're right, Ned. Maybe you're right."
9781,There's only three left in the world!
9782,"I'm squeezing... I'm squee-zing it. Hey, I squeezed so hard it went into my hand."
9783,"Wow, this plankton's only 33 cents."
9784,"Sure, by their standards, but we live in America."
9785,But it's so cheap.
9786,"Well, let's see what's in the ol' vacation fund."
9787,"A little late for ""could've's,"" Marge."
9788,"No, mon, let's go home to Jamaica. I and I been in Babylon too long."
9789,"No, no Japan. Jamaica! I wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side."
9790,"Oh, so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh?"
9791,C'mon!
9792,"Sayonara, suckers!"
9793,"That's not how I remember it. Besides, if we want to see Japanese people we could have gone to the zoo."
9794,What? The guy who washes the elephants is Japanese. His name is Takashi. He's in my book club.
9795,"Yeah, isn't it amazing? They're filming one right now in the bathroom."
9796,It's gonna be on towards the end of the flight.
9797,"Marge, they stole my idea!"
9798,Here's our room!
9799,I don't have time for that.
9800,"Ohh, yeah..."
9801,"Oh, all right."
9802,Whew. All that seizing made me hungry.
9803,The toilet recommended a place called AmericaTown.
9804,I can't believe they stuck us at Taxachusetts.
9805,"Hey, you know, I once knew a man from Nantucket."
9806,Let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.
9807,"Oooh, they got our number."
9808,One square watermelon please.
9809,It's worth every cent. I'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
9810,"Oh, of course. You're right. You know, I read about a Shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... Run, Bart!"
9811,Looks like he's doing a commercial.
9812,"Mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. Hey, what's Baby Huey doing?"
9813,Hmmm...
9814,"Spare some salt, tubby?"
9815,"Hey, that's mine!"
9816,"Like we say in my country, ""Hasta la vista, baby."""
9817,"Yeah, and I'm Clobbersaurus."
9818,All hail Emperor Clobbersaurus!
9819,Thank God. I couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.
9820,"Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin and I wanted to be Oshi, but they made me Ori."
9821,I didn't... What is it? Lunch?
9822,"Don't worry, ichiban. I'll show you something Japanese."
9823,It's a crane. The Japanese believe they bring good luck.
9824,Shimatta baka-me!
9825,This sucks. What else is on?
9826,"Well, I haven't talked it over with the family, but I think we'd all like a free dinner at AmericaTown."
9827,Ignor-- what?
9828,"Do ""OW THAT HURTS."""
9829,Could someone please whack my hernia back in?
9830,Is the answer Japan?
9831,Why are you so cruel?
9832,"Well, at least we're past the lightning round."
9833,"Hmmm, I see... I sure hope they don't have an ice cream round."
9834,Marge! Your shoe!
9835,"Well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock."
9836,It burns! It burns!
9837,It burns! It burns!
9838,"Before I go, I want to say something. Game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. But somewhere along the line, you lost your way. For shame."
9839,"I love this show. Take that, you stupid hosers!"
9840,Undo! Undo!
9841,My children deserve to see me get a free gift.
9842,But I like the nice things you said about me.
9843,"Hello, I, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos."
9844,What kind a mint?
9845,"Yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too."
9846,"Relax, we're in an electric car."
9847,See? Everything's fine.
9848,"Hey, dolphins."
9849,Oopsie.
9850,"Hi, girls."
9851,Ohhh.
9852,Salt water seems to be good for it.
9853,"Um, I'm sorry, the car did not meet my eco-concerns. Can I have my prize now?"
9854,We didn't? That's odd. Seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
9855,"Well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now."
9856,"Aww, movie tickets! That hardly seems worth destroying a car."
9857,Who else is in it?
9858,"Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge. No different than me or Lenny."
9859,"Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny."
9860,Okay...
9861,"Uh, you're thinking about me, right?"
9862,I will now.
9863,Bo-ring.
9864,At least the Jimmy Stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.
9865,"Well, that was a stinker."
9866,"Oh, you're just saying that because your ""boyfriend"" was in it. I'll bet you would've hated it if me and Lenny were Mr. Smith."
9867,"Oh, that's it! I'm telling Mr. Stupidest man alive what I really thought of his movie! Hey, Gibson!"
9868,Got a pencil?
9869,Thanks.
9870,stupid...
9871,'Preciate it.
9872,"Door, Marge."
9873,"And I've been lookin' for you, too, pal!"
9874,"Listen, Gibson, I'm tired of Hollywood pretty boys like you and Jack Valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. You see this?"
9875,It symbolizes that she's my property and I own her.
9876,Huh?
9877,"Really? You want my help? Marge, did you hear that? Mel Gibson wants my help! Mel Gibson!"
9878,Shuut-uup...
9879,"She's always doing that, Mel."
9880,Guilty as charged.
9881,"You had me at ""Hello."""
9882,"A mini-van... Oh boy, you celebrities sure know how to live. What is this? Toyota Previa?"
9883,Sweet.
9884,"Okay, while Mel and I are working, why don't you guys do the town? I hear all the stars eat at a place called Planet Hollywood."
9885,"Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks."
9886,"Okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. Everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny."
9887,I mean Lisa.
9888,"Okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. It'll let us see your playful side."
9889,"Yeah, but..."
9890,They will if you set up that the dog is evil. All you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
9891,Ah-ah-ah! Now here's your biggest problem of all...
9892,"And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action."
9893,"Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that."
9894,It was symbolism. He was mad.
9895,Piece o' cake. Now where's that kid with my latte?
9896,... we-shot-last-night...
9897,"Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!"
9898,Here comes two!
9899,I second that motion...
9900,...with a vengeance!
9901,Those movies sucked. I only saw 'em to get Marge into the sack. PS: mission accomplished.
9902,"Yeah, guys like me."
9903,"Do the words ""Executive Producer"" mean anything to you?"
9904,We'll talk.
9905,Watch out! Comin' through! Mach schnell!
9906,I'm on it.
9907,"How old are you, anyway?"
9908,Sorry I asked.
9909,"Oh, crap! Here they come!"
9910,"Hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. We're not finished yet."
9911,No time talk! Need steal car! Must save powerful but controversial movie!
9912,Hel-lo.
9913,"Quick, Mel, get in!"
9914,"Movies aren't stupid! They fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""Lethal Weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny."
9915,"Before ""Lethal Weapon 2"", I never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now I check every time."
9916,They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
9917,No offense.
9918,"Well, I think we lost 'em."
9919,"Oh, wait. There they are."
9920,"Great idea, Mel. Now it's my turn."
9921,"I'm tired of running away. Did ""Braveheart"" run away? Did ""Payback"" run away? It's time we showed those suits what we're made of."
9922,"It's your plan, from ""Braveheart."" Your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."
9923,"Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it..."
9924,I think so.
9925,No.
9926,"I don't get it, Mel. How can you be so calm and cool? My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies."
9927,"Okay, that's it. Let's get ready to meet our public."
9928,/ Ow!
9929,We shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
9930,"Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel."
9931,"How did the country lose its way, Mel? When did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?"
9932,"Well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture."
9933,"Hey, what about a prequel to something? Everybody loves prequels."
9934,"Okay, Mr. Difficult. How about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some?"
9935,"No, wait. A ghost who wins the lottery! You could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. Ooh, what about Indiana Jones? Does anyone own the rights to that?"
9936,"Hey, Mel. I fell out."
9937,Thank you for getting me out of work.
9938,"Yeah, he's somethin' else, all right."
9939,"Hey, that looks like Bart."
9940,"Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer."
9941,What? Time to go?
9942,Candy bar?
9943,I'd say he's coming out of the Pep Closet.
9944,They become your slaves...
9945,"It's all about trust, honey."
9946,Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
9947,Sure you do. All your favorite stars have used drugs: Brett Butler.... Tim Allen...
9948,Andy Dick...
9949,"Yeah, and I'm a size four."
9950,Why you little...!
9951,"Son, let's forget all about that drug thing. Why don't you just come down and have some taffy?"
9952,Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...
9953,Ow!
9954,"Geez, what's the big deal? Look, I'll even eat some."
9955,Now--
9956,"Way to guilt him, Marge!"
9957,Do I get a card?
9958,Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...
9959,"Well, I have been thinking about making them into cut-offs..."
9960,"I tell ya, the kid's a wonder. He organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action."
9961,You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment dealy.
9962,Got my whole week in there.
9963,"Oh, this thing'll do anything. Watch, I'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. No, wait... I'll make it say ""Whatsa matta you?"" in Turkish."
9964,And look at this. A cheese grater!
9965,"Well, if you want one, they sell 'em at..."
9966,The boy's still studying?
9967,"He's gone from Goofus to Gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills."
9968,"Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday."
9969,Oh... Marge!
9970,Really? With butterscotch on it?
9971,"Marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband."
9972,That was fun. We have to get out more often.
9973,"Well, sure, if it's true."
9974,Ray J. funny... or O.J. funny?
9975,Even mine?
9976,"Hey, I had Lenny's name on that!"
9977,Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!
9978,"Hey, you found my needlenose pliers."
9979,"Wake up, honey!"
9980,He quit blinking. He says that's when they get ya.
9981,After we trusted you...
9982,Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna have a tummyache.
9983,"Hey, there was just air in mine."
9984,"We should have paid more attention to these side-effects. It's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea..."
9985,"But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?"
9986,"So I gave up tap for jazz, and I've never regretted it. And here's why..."
9987,I'm on top of it.
9988,"My God, is she brave. Standing up to that freaked-out junkie."
9989,Why don't you just tell everybody?
9990,The frame store! You monster!
9991,And Mark McGwire gave you an autographed bat.
9992,Who cares? That man can really slug.
9993,"Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy's got it covered."
9994,"I WORK HARD FOR THE MONEY! / SO HARD FOR THE MONEY! / OH, I SOMETHING, SOMETHING MONEY! / COME ON, GIVE ME LOTS OF HONEY!"
9995,So hard... for the money... So hard... Turn tape over.
9996,"God bless you, Nelson Muntz."
9997,"Hey, you , you cut me off! Ah, yeah, you!"
9998,"Oh, right. ambulance! Think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards."
9999,Here we are kids -- the zoo.
10000,"If he's so smart, how come he's dead?"
10001,Ooo... pointless nostalgia.
10002,I'd sure hate to be him.
10003,"Hey, I smell cake! Cake that says ""Farewell"" and ""Best Wishes""!"
10004,I'll have you know I wandered off from the tour.
10005,"Oh, I like food all right."
10006,"I LIKE PIZZA / I LIKE BAGELS / I LIKE HOT DOGS, WITH MUSTARD AND BEER..."
10007,"I'LL EAT EGGPLANT / I COULD EVEN EAT A BABY DEER... LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... WHO'S THAT BABY DEER ON THE LAWN, THERE..."
10008,Sorry.
10009,"No, it usually takes a few hours."
10010,"Thanks for the chance. You won't never regret this, Mr. Editing Guy!"
10011,"We don't need no stinkin' ""E"". Restaurant Review... No. Eatery Evaluation... No. Food box... Go or no go? By Homer... No. Earl. No. Bill Simpson!"
10012,Well -- what do you think?
10013,What's wrong with it?
10014,It was so hard to get to 500 words...
10015,"No, no, you're right. It's a joke. Everyone laugh at the funny joke . I'll be right back with the real review."
10016,Still not clean! Stink of failure still on me!
10017,Still not clean! Still not clean!
10018,"Okay, what restaurant should we review?"
10019,"Great. Now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious..."
10020,"That's brilliant. And they have this sweet, sweet chocolate mousse -- really, the only word for it is ."
10021,How about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
10022,We make a good team. A groin-grabbingly good team!
10023,"How about ""screw Flanders""?"
10024,"Aw, they're both good."
10025,Woo hoo! Stop the presses!
10026,"Okay, start the presses!"
10027,Whatever. I'll be at Moe's.
10028,"Marge, shh! It's important that no one know that I'm a food critic."
10029,"Can ya believe it, Marge? This job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!"
10030,Why you little...
10031,Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. But this is only the beginning...
10032,"There's the coffee mug from ""Heartbeeps""!"
10033,Let me see.
10034,Stupid script! Nearly wrecked Jim Carrey's career! You-- I'm gonna... What?
10035,And the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
10036,"Look, Marge, I'm making a difference in people's lives!"
10037,Are you gonna fire me for swiping office supplies?
10038,Whew.
10039,"Why, you... You made them cancel ""Platypus Man!"""
10040,And the Cosby Mysteries! That show had limitless possibilities!
10041,Sorry.
10042,"For you, perhaps."
10043,I've given out my share of bad reviews.
10044,It lost some points 'cause it had a Hot Wheel on it.
10045,"Oh, that's classic."
10046,Okay.
10047,"Hm. This pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy."
10048,The other critics told me to be mean. And you should always give in to peer pressure.
10049,Always.
10050,"Ah, not bad... if lasagna is Italian for ""pile of puke."""
10051,"Well, I hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. Hm, I seem to be missing a piece of my ear. Touché!"
10052,Mm.
10053,"Sorry, Marge. I'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up."
10054,"Marge, I'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: ""Shake"" and ""Bake."""
10055,"People change, Marge. My palate has grown more sophisticated."
10056,Oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... Gotta go!
10057,"So come to The Legless Frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. P.S. Parking was ample."
10058,People will think what I tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
10059,"Nobody talks to me that way! I'm Homer Simpson! The most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! You hear me? No comeuppance! We'll be right back."
10060,"I don't need Lisa to write a good review. ""The food at the Gilded Truffle really..."" Uh... What's a good word?"
10061,"Sucks! That's great. ""And the bread was really..."" C'mon, help me out here."
10062,"""Rough!"" Ah, I don't know. You've been pitching that all night."
10063,Chewy! That's inspired.
10064,Are you crazy? A dog can't type. Unfortunately.
10065,Really? Like what?
10066,"Oh, Marge, something bad usually happens to me when I go in anywhere."
10067,A bat! Now that's a new one.
10068,"So what are you up to, young lady?"
10069,"Oh. Well, I'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me."
10070,Pedestrian.
10071,Uninspired.
10072,I didn't say stop!
10073,"Oh, So full... Bellybutton moving from innie to outie..."
10074,"Ooh, sweet."
10075,"Eh, I've had a good run."
10076,Noooo!
10077,"Oh, Lisa... you saved me! And after all the bad things I said about you."
10078,"Oh, Lisa, the important thing is, I didn't get my comeuppance, and I never will."
10079,"I know, honey. The important thing is -- run!"
10080,Finally getting my comeuppance.
10081,But it was worth it to get back our super Sugar Crisp cereal.
10082,Can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp...
10083,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
10084,He's dead!
10085,He's definitely dead!
10086,"Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is..."
10087,To make sure that no one knows that you're dead. And if anyone asks... you're not dead.
10088,Hey Maude! Look who's helping me clean the chimney.
10089,"Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily."
10090,"Relax, I'm fine. But when I do die, I don't want any autopsies."
10091,"Wow, it sure is slippery up here."
10092,"Aww, she missed it."
10093,"Hey Maude, I'm home. Uh-oh. I think I'm having a heart attack."
10094,And that's the end of that chapter.
10095,Try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.
10096,"When I think about Ned, I can't help but remember the look on his face when Marge drove over..."
10097,"Oh, wait... What I'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. Anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife."
10098,"We'll miss you, buddy."
10099,"Hey, we just got away with murder. And it was so easy."
10100,"You know, I've never liked that little wiener Milhouse."
10101,But you got to kill...
10102,Y'ello?
10103,Who is this?
10104,"No, it's Homer."
10105,"Dear God, it's Homer. If you really love me, you'll save my life now."
10106,"Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park."
10107,"Lisa, the pet cemetery."
10108,"Bart, spooky roller disco."
10109,And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
10110,"Now, Flanders, I want you to..."
10111,"He's undead, all right."
10112,Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...
10113,"Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders?"
10114,"Flanders, stop that."
10115,"Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?"
10116,"Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood."
10117,Absolutely.
10118,Doin' what now?
10119,"That can't be true, honey. If it were, I'd be terrified."
10120,Uh-oh.
10121,"Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed..."
10122,"Hey, this milk's broken."
10123,Stop! Ow!
10124,I'm caught on something!
10125,But I was gonna loot you a present!
10126,"Wonders, Lisa? Or blunders?"
10127,"Implied, Lisa? Or implode?"
10128,"Thank you, sweet clown."
10129,In death you saved us all.
10130,I can still hear his voice on the wind.
10131,Just like the dead clown promised.
10132,That's us!
10133,"Certainly. I am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie ""Shine."""
10134,Uh... Shiny McShine?
10135,"Good-bye Lisa, remember me as I am... filled with murderous rage."
10136,"Well, son. I guess this is the end. But we've both had long, full lives. Oh, right."
10137,And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!
10138,I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.
10139,You're right. I gotta let it go. All that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.
10140,"Ooh, there's Ross Perot, Dr. Laura, Spike Lee..."
10141,"Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...?"
10142,Tom Arnold?! What the hell's going on?!
10143,So we're all gonna die?
10144,The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!
10145,"Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell."
10146,"Ooo, you don't want to get Zorro mad."
10147,Not fast enough!
10148,I have to go to ze lobby!
10149,"You're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either."
10150,To the top please.
10151,"Swim, my pretties."
10152,Sh-sh-shh!
10153,"Woo! You go, Zorro!"
10154,Why that little... He insulted your honor!
10155,"Sir, I demand satisfaction."
10156,I challenge you to a duel.
10157,"Will you duel, or are you a coward?!"
10158,"Uh, uh. ""H"" is for Homer."
10159,Heavyset? What's that supposed to mean?
10160,"No Tommy Tune, eh? Oh, that's it. You insulted my honor."
10161,I demand satisfaction! I challenge you to a duel.
10162,Really? But you've never given anyone a free beer.
10163,"Wow, a free beer! And I owe it all to a little glove slap. GLOVE SLAP..."
10164,"BABY, GLOVE SLAP..."
10165,Coming through... challenge... duel... Hi Lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction...
10166,Huh?
10167,Aisle six?
10168,Duelling at dawn? How did it ever come to this?
10169,"Sir, that is an insult! I challenge you... What?"
10170,Oh.
10171,"Oh, honey, I had the worst nightmare. This glove kept slapping people and I was getting blamed."
10172,"He's out there, isn't he?"
10173,"Hey, I'm not dead yet."
10174,"Save me, Marge. I saved you!"
10175,"Oh Marge, that's in the past. Just let it go."
10176,And somebody wanted to get rid of it in April.
10177,"Flanders, you gotta help me. Is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?"
10178,"I was afraid of that. Well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. You know, I've always wanted to tell you how mu..."
10179,"Ah, screw it."
10180,Ooh! How 'bout that house?
10181,Lousy show-offs.
10182,"Come on, Carter, build us a house, you lazy bum."
10183,"Come on, move it!"
10184,How should I know?
10185,'Cause I'm trying to think! What would Zorro do?
10186,Zo-rrooo!
10187,Rural route 9? That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!
10188,"Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides..."
10189,Race ya to the swimmin' hole!
10190,"Com'on, Maw. Bring the young 'uns! There's no leeches! Lots of snakes, though."
10191,Just think of 'em as cats with rabies.
10192,"Hello, kitty."
10193,You little scamp.
10194,Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
10195,That's my girl. Let the agriculture begin!
10196,"All right, let's see what the old girl can do."
10197,Hang on.
10198,And... there.
10199,Now we're talkin'!
10200,Go get Lassie.
10201,This car was made in Guatemala.
10202,I bought these shoes from a hobo.
10203,"I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming."
10204,"Aw, what do you know?"
10205,"Oh, that's just superstition."
10206,You watch me. I'll grow something out there.
10207,"Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that."
10208,"Oh, a little bit of everything."
10209,"Something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil."
10210,"And for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... I'm down."
10211,Move the handbrake...
10212,"Ohhh, that's heaven."
10213,"Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?"
10214,"I'm only one man, Marge."
10215,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm no farmer."
10216,"Leave me alone, you big bully."
10217,"Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a coward's way out."
10218,"Oh, you're right. I'm a coward. I've made such a mess of things. If only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow..."
10219,Wait a minute.
10220,Easy... careful... steady...
10221,Time to give Mother Nature a little goose.
10222,"Well, Marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?"
10223,Of course not. But you know something? Sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.
10224,"Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope."
10225,"From the producers of ""Waiting to Exhale."""
10226,Shut up and kiss me.
10227,It's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!
10228,"That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."
10229,Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.
10230,"Brace yourselves, everybody. You're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. You might want to crane your necks upward now to save time."
10231,Ta-da!
10232,"All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible."
10233,Ah-ha!
10234,Oh... Where are you?
10235,"Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn."
10236,This better be good.
10237,A sprout!
10238,And there's some more!
10239,Who cares what it is? It's growing! I've saved the farm!
10240,Look at my babies. This tomato will be Heinz ketchup. And this to-mah-to will be Hunt's catsup.
10241,"Bup, no fighting, boys."
10242,"Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants."
10243,"Addictive, eh?"
10244,"Aw, thanks honey."
10245,"Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?"
10246,Don't push. There's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
10247,"You're scaring the customers, honey."
10248,Okay.
10249,Those dirty rotten...
10250,"I wish I could make a difference, Lisa, but I'm just one man."
10251,How much?
10252,One hundred and... May I speak to my family for a moment?
10253,"Did you see the way Emile's lookin' at Mindy? Hoo-hoo, I think something's going on there."
10254,"Oh, yeah. Let's take it."
10255,We all agree that a hundred and fifty million is an insult. The least we can accept is a hundred and fifty billion.
10256,They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...
10257,Stop eating our future!
10258,Get the... get outta... bad animals! Go home!
10259,"Thank God, there's one left!"
10260,"Look, a flying saucer!"
10261,"There, there. We had quite a scare today. But you're gonna make us millions. Yes you are."
10262,"I know, honey. But what can I do, as an individual? I wouldn't know where to begin."
10263,"I agree, but how?"
10264,They're after the tomacco!
10265,"Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is..."
10266,"No, I'd rather die!"
10267,Take it!
10268,"So, Mindy? How did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?"
10269,Cash'll be okay! Or stock? Does your company have stock?
10270,Mindy?
10271,Mindy and I are just hammering out a payment plan. We'll talk Monday!
10272,I don't know why we ever left in the first place.
10273,"Hey, are we duellin' or what?"
10274,I think so. The bone stopped the bullet.
10275,After pie.
10276,Snooze... need more snooze.
10277,Did somebody say num num?
10278,"Oh, I'm twenty-six hours late for work. No time for Maggie."
10279,"Oooh, where's Waldo?"
10280,"Nope. Nope. This would be a lot easier without all these people. Nope. Nope. It's there-- Uh, nope."
10281,"Waldo, where are you?!"
10282,Oh sure. Single me out.
10283,Over there.
10284,"Heh, heh. I'd hate to see the look on ol' Burnsie's face if he knew I was just gettin' in. Hee hee."
10285,"Mmm, who is that? Big ugly nose... bald... liver spot... liver spot... Mmmm."
10286,No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
10287,Safe in the core. And now...
10288,This is the worst day ever.
10289,Mr. Burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.
10290,Okay.
10291,"Oh, Marge, I'm sorry. I can't make it."
10292,The cooling tank just blew and they're taking Lenny to the hospital.
10293,"Yeah, so I'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what I really want."
10294,Are poo and ass taken?
10295,Damn! Could my life get any worse?!
10296,"Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on a bowling ball?"
10297,What a rotten day!
10298,Really?
10299,Lenny...
10300,Practice ball! Practice ball!
10301,Real real real real real!
10302,Woo hoo!
10303,Ow!
10304,Woo hoo! I'm ten pins away from perfection.
10305,Why won't they come over? I'm so lonely.
10306,"Get down, get down, get down!"
10307,Woo hoo! This is the greatest day of my life!
10308,"In your face, to-do list!"
10309,"Thank you! Thank you! But there was someone else with me on that alley. I'm talkin' about the big man, Carl."
10310,"Thank you, Bart's teacher. You know, kids, my teachers said I would never amount to anything. And until last week, they were dead right. But now I've achieved perfection."
10311,Any questions?
10312,"Yes, Bart's weird friend."
10313,You've got a father. He's just a dud.
10314,Next question.
10315,"Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on."
10316,"Um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?"
10317,"Hey, this was supposed to be about me. Now, any other questions? Pumpkin face? Headgear? Chicken pox? Smelly? Lazy eye? Spikey head? Okay, class dismissed. Rock on!"
10318,"Yes, Kent?"
10319,"Well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do I read from the sheet labeled ""Jokes"" or ""Answers?"""
10320,"Dream on, Drunky!"
10321,Flavor of the month? Me?
10322,I 'unno... Because you weren't cute anymore?
10323,"Eww, thanks for sharing!"
10324,"Hello, everybody!"
10325,Did somebody say a perfect game?
10326,I'm doing a walk-on. It's a show business thing. So how y'all doin'? Let's see... What's in the news today?
10327,"Hey, I thought you never talked."
10328,"Remember Springfield, keep on swinging!"
10329,"Hey, everybody! I'm gonna be on TV again."
10330,That's right. You've got a special daddy.
10331,"Woo hoo! First stop, Maude Flanders."
10332,But she said I...
10333,"Lisa, I know what's going on here. They did it to Jesus and now they're doing it to me."
10334,"Well, in bowling ability."
10335,Sweet bowling alley balloon. You're my only friend.
10336,What was that about?
10337,"Marge, has my life peaked?"
10338,Mm-hmmm.
10339,You're right!
10340,"I can't believe it, Moe. The greatest feat of my life is already forgotten."
10341,"Save your tears, Moe. Save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope."
10342,"THIS IS THE END / MY ONLY FRIEND, THE END / WEIRD SCENES INSIDE THE GOLD MINE..."
10343,"Well, world, this is it. You know, I always thought you'd die before me. But now as I prepare my soul for an eternity of fire and poking..."
10344,I wanna live!
10345,It's a glandular problemmmm!
10346,"Oooh, Morlocks... CHUDS... Mole People!"
10347,"Oh, Lord... you saved me. I guess you had some higher purpose in mind."
10348,"Not anymore, Ron. Now, I'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. Something noble, but easy."
10349,That's great. Even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
10350,That's it! Kids are the answer! I'll dedicate my life to my children.
10351,No. I don't want your pity or your money.
10352,I do what now?
10353,"Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention."
10354,I can see I'm not needed here.
10355,"Lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?"
10356,"I've been so blind. I'll lavish my attention on Maggie, the forgotten Simpson."
10357,"Mag-gie. It's me, Dad-dy!"
10358,Daddy's gonna spend a lot more time with you. Yes he is. Yes he is.
10359,"Where's Mag-gie? Where's Mag-gie? Hey, where is she?"
10360,There you are.
10361,"Hi Maggie! I'm Homie-Womie, the Teletubby. And I'm all man, in case you've heard otherwise. Let's see what's on Tummy-vision!"
10362,"Ow! Ow, that hurts! Owww! Ohhh!"
10363,"Whee! Whee! Don't be scared, Maggie. Daddy won't drop you. Whee!"
10364,"You're a tough cookie, Maggie, but I'm gonna win you over. Just like I did with Lisa."
10365,"Hi, honey!"
10366,"C'mon, Maggie. You can trust me."
10367,Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!
10368,"I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things between us had gotten this bad."
10369,What are you pointing at? The ocean?
10370,That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.
10371,"See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub. Except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels."
10372,Nothing to worry about. Just a little wave.
10373,"And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy can't struggle against. Help! Help! Somebody, help!"
10374,"Oh, current... too strong... I know! If I sink to the bottom I can run to the shore."
10375,Maggie! Call Aquaman!
10376,"Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me."
10377,"Oh, you do love me!"
10378,"Actually, that was before I went in the ocean."
10379,Then don't.
10380,"Well, all I care about is that my little girl loves me. And we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on."
10381,"Good girl, Maggie. You knocked down all the pins. But you stepped over the line just a little bit, so I'll have to give you a five."
10382,And that gives you a final score of... two ninety-five.
10383,"Looks like Daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby."
10384,Yes it is. It's very good and you're a good little baby. Yes you are.
10385,And these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.
10386,"Hey, there's someone else in here."
10387,He's named after what he is.
10388,"Yes, I will have the... Pl_penlügen. And don't skimp on the D__dlemünch."
10389,"Hey, Apu, Manjula. You guys are still married?"
10390,"Pay up, Marge."
10391,"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all."
10392,"Hey Apu. Sittin' in the ice cream cooler, eh?"
10393,"Whoa, too much information! Thanks for the mental picture. Why don't you tell us what you really think?"
10394,"Could you be any more...? Hel-lo! Look, just give me some ice cream."
10395,More than I wanted to knoooow!
10396,But the cans seal in the flavor.
10397,"So, how's the tribe comin' along? Any papooses?"
10398,Decided? That's classic. Decided. Babies just happen.
10399,Really? On top and underneath?
10400,"Well, don't worry, I can help ya. I'm all about ideas."
10401,"Kids, come and get it!"
10402,"Now, this situation is guaranteed to end in pregnancy."
10403,"Up-bup-bup-bup! That's an Apu question. You're ""Greg."""
10404,My mistake. Stay in the moment.
10405,And that's my cue to exit.
10406,I just wanted to invite you to the wrap party. And that's my cue to exit.
10407,"Man, the last nine months sure were crazy."
10408,"Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies."
10409,Yeah. It looked just like that.
10410,Mine tasted like strawberry.
10411,Mmm... Ovulicious.
10412,"Free baby cola? Apu hits the jackpot, and I'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets."
10413,I've been waiting so long to hear that.
10414,"Ooh, look at that. Ooh, gingerbread house. Hansel and Gretel are set for life."
10415,"Boy, that Hansel sure can eat."
10416,My corneas! You were saying?
10417,"Eight kids. Hm, I'm sterile, right baby doll?"
10418,Beautiful.
10419,"Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling about this."
10420,Marge... They've turned into jerks.
10421,"No, Marge. No!"
10422,"She's no Liza, but it works."
10423,Don't worry. I brought some chloroform.
10424,There... and... there...
10425,"Okay, this is gettin' weird."
10426,"Please, Mr. Kidkill, look into your heart. I know these babies have a lifetime contract. But what if I put together an even better act for you? Something sensational!"
10427,Not any more!
10428,"Okay, okay... don't panic. Release the mongoose!"
10429,Stupid mongoose! get the snake! The snake! Do I look like a snake? Ow! Ow! He bit me Show's over! Show's over! Next show is eight o'clock and ten!
10430,What an age we live in.
10431,I remember television!
10432,Nah. We'll go next month.
10433,"Wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! I feel like I've gone back in a time machine."
10434,What an age we live in.
10435,"Oh, no. You're not gettin' me on that dance floor. Don't try and make me. If I have to get a divorce I will."
10436,"That's right, never!"
10437,Oh! I need a dance partner! What about you?
10438,Woo-hoo!
10439,"It's mine. Finally, I've won the respect of my fellow... Get away from it!"
10440,Promise you won't laugh?
10441,I don't know how.
10442,Will you teach me?
10443,A gang! That's the answer.
10444,"Remember to rebel against authority, kids."
10445,"Quiet, Marge. The motorcycle and I are trying to sleep."
10446,"I know, I know. Just tune her out."
10447,"Yeah, that's the life for me, Marge. Cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers."
10448,"Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa."
10449,"You know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles."
10450,"This gang's for rebels, Flanders, not conformos."
10451,"The first meeting of ""Hell's Satans"" is called to order."
10452,"I'm the president and the decision is mine. We're Hell's Satans. Besides, I've already made our club jackets."
10453,"Can't hassle us, pig. We're goin' the speed limit. Oink, oink, oink."
10454,"You can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the Cobras."
10455,Oink! Oink! Oink!
10456,How could I be down a thousand bucks?
10457,"And what if we don't, Pops?"
10458,They printed my photo of our gang!
10459,Carl looks great. Can't take a bad picture of that guy.
10460,If you'd've been awake you would have said no. You can see the bind I was in.
10461,You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coincidence. My gang's name is also the...
10462,Okay.
10463,All right.
10464,Sorry.
10465,Done.
10466,"Caps and frisbees, sir."
10467,And some pogs.
10468,"Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter..."
10469,But you have so much inner beauty.
10470,You're done. Next!
10471,"Okay, bikers, that's it. Benjamin Franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? They're gone! Woo hoo!"
10472,... And those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look I get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
10473,"Yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. Marge? Marge?!"
10474,Really? Read it.
10475,"Oh, that's sweet."
10476,"Now don't worry. I am gonna search high and low for your mother. But just in case I don't find her, I want you to contact this agency."
10477,I just don't want to be alone.
10478,"Excuse me, has anyone seen a woman wearing..."
10479,That's more like it. I'm looking for...
10480,I'll show you.
10481,"Okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. Long story short, my ""old lady"" was..."
10482,"Oh, goodness. Mmm, some people never learn."
10483,I guess I'll never find her.
10484,"No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever."
10485,Uh-oh.
10486,"You and me, chopper to chopper."
10487,Never! It was a gift from Newsweek!
10488,Give me back my wife!
10489,"Whaddaya say, honey?"
10490,No dice!
10491,Taking care of some unfinished business.
10492,Go! Go! Go!
10493,"Hey, why is this door locked?"
10494,What's going on? And I want the non-gay explanation.
10495,"Oh, thank God."
10496,Where are the refreshments?
10497,Maybe you should shut up.
10498,"Forget it. He releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: Feed the Children, Save the Whales, even Release the Hounds."
10499,"Get 'em, boy. Hit those smart-ass books."
10500,"Uhh. Is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? Is that what this is, Lisa?"
10501,"So, who am I beating up?"
10502,"Now, let's see. This will make three Christmases I saved versus eight I ruined... two were kind of a draw..."
10503,Sorry.
10504,Writhing Funzos / In my sack / Makes me happy / Makes me hurt my back...
10505,Hah! If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that...
10506,"Please, Mr. Coleman. We can explain."
10507,"Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."
10508,I think what Lisa meant to say is...
10509,"Hey, it is Christmas. We'd better get home."
10510,"Um, uh... Mr. Coleman, I've been thinking... My wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... Aw, heck! Would you like to spend Christmas with us?"
10511,I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
10512,Get her! She's doing something!
10513,Our junk!
10514,And the exits are sealed! Go to plan B!
10515,Come on!
10516,Oh no you don't!
10517,"Oh, precious heirlooms! Daddy would never let them take you."
10518,Oh. That was scary. We came this close to losing our spare Christmas tree stand. You monster.
10519,Useless? This flash cube has two flashes left!
10520,"Hey, let's go skiing right now!"
10521,Woo hoo!
10522,Where?!
10523,"Hmmm... ""The Widowmaker,"" Oh, that one's for the ladies. ""Spinebuster,"" boring. Ooh, ""Colostomizer."""
10524,Don't hurt me! Here's my wallet.
10525,Flanders!
10526,"That suit's a little revealing, isn't it?"
10527,Quit it! Must wash eyes! J--
10528,Uh-oh.
10529,"Okay, don't panic. Remember what the instructor said..."
10530,Stupid sexy Flanders!
10531,"Ow, my legs! This is the worst pain ever..."
10532,Single.
10533,You missed all the fun.
10534,I want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy.
10535,Whoa-whoa-whoa! Don't go nuts.
10536,Uh... better than that.
10537,Perfect.
10538,"We'll be fine, honey. The main thing is for you to get better."
10539,Take that! Woo! Woo! H-Hey! Hey!
10540,Gotcha! Gotcha! / I'll show you!
10541,"And you're ""interferon"" with our good time!"
10542,'Mornin'...
10543,I don't know.
10544,"I guess, or one of her friends."
10545,"Come on, ""bikini inspector!"" ""Scrub toilet?"" Okay, that was a practice. Practice... Practice... Okay, here we go. ""Feed fish."""
10546,"Oh, it's a great hat. No one's questioning the hat."
10547,"Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!"
10548,"C'mon, eat, you lazy fish."
10549,"Oh, but Lenny just got some bottle rockets."
10550,"That's not true, he left it on the bus."
10551,"Lisa, help!"
10552,I got the groceries!
10553,It's the bread of astronauts.
10554,Oh yeah. You were way off.
10555,"Hello, Lollipop Island? There's a little girl here who had too many sourballs."
10556,"Anyway, where were we? Hello? Hello? They hung up."
10557,Marco!
10558,Marco!
10559,Marc--
10560,"Sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? He hit her again."
10561,Jesus?
10562,"Lisa, help!"
10563,What's wrong with us?!
10564,"You don't? 'Cause that's what I said! Tell her, Bart."
10565,Yes...
10566,Yes! Yesssss!
10567,"Help us, Virtual Doc! Look at me! I'm on my knees!"
10568,Leprosy? I can't believe it! That fortune cookie was right.
10569,Mops? The cure sounds worse than the disease.
10570,"Well, I think we're on the outs with Him, but I know someone who's even holier than Jesus."
10571,Use your brains to help us. Your delicious brains.
10572,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You wonderful man!"
10573,Bart! Leave some for Rod and Todd!
10574,"Here you go, lad."
10575,So you're shunning us.
10576,"Oh, thank you good sir."
10577,"That it is. We'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married."
10578,Howdy. And thanks for not recoiling in horror.
10579,Really? The whole beach?
10580,Electric needle room?!
10581,I figured it out after I ate one of my chest sores.
10582,"This place is a blast. All we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing."
10583,"Come on, loosen up. This is paradise."
10584,That's me!
10585,Aloha / Aloha Until we meet a-
10586,"Bill, bill. Oooh! Llib! Eh-- Wait a minute. Bill?!"
10587,"Huh? Springfield University Homecoming! Finally, a chance to relive my golden college years..."
10588,"Remember my love affair with Ali McGraw? She used to call me ""Preppy."" Then she died."
10589,Then the big game between Springfield U. and Springfield A & M. I hate Springfield U. so much.
10590,So much.
10591,"My old dorm room. Come on, baby, let's matriculate."
10592,"My old roommates, the nerds. Ya workin'?"
10593,One million times...
10594,"... Yeah, so because of me, all the dorms now have security phones."
10595,Make me.
10596,Okay. All right. Okay.
10597,I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
10598,Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you? This calls for a prank. I see a bucket...
10599,"Oh, this is gonna be so great."
10600,"So when Dean Peterson opens his door, this bucket of Super Glue is gonna drop right on his head..."
10601,He-- What the?!
10602,"Oh, real original. Who did this?"
10603,"Oh, that's it. You're through, dean!"
10604,Now who's the dean?
10605,"Oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? Oh, there's no such thing."
10606,What guys? I wanna see the freaks.
10607,Easy... easy...
10608,Too far.
10609,What? I can see fine.
10610,That had nothing to do with the bucket.
10611,Cure me! Cure me!
10612,Yeah. And I got a bucket on my head!
10613,I see the light! It burns!
10614,"Uh, Miracle Boy?"
10615,"I believe I had hair. Oh, here they are."
10616,I can't come up with an idea for my homecoming float. Do it for me.
10617,Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...
10618,"Yeah, you're right."
10619,It's not to scale.
10620,And chili fries!
10621,Can't make a float without flowers.
10622,Yeah.
10623,Woo hoo! Go S.U.!
10624,"Yeah, well you went to a cow college!"
10625,"Okay, who needs another lamb rack?"
10626,Lisa? Ham hock? Tri tip?
10627,"Well, I think the veal might have died of loneliness..."
10628,"Oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, Marge?"
10629,I forgot my float!
10630,"Quick, pass me down!"
10631,Wait! Hang on!
10632,"Wait! Wait! I got a float too! Listen up, 'cause I gotta explain a lot of it!"
10633,Boo?
10634,"Out of the way, Baryshnikov!"
10635,"Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit."
10636,"No, wait! I got a kid who's a miracle worker! He'll heal him up real good."
10637,Or else what?
10638,"Oh, right. The ice pick."
10639,"Bart, I need a miracle!"
10640,"Please, Bart. You've gotta use your powers! I'm beggin' ya!"
10641,"Bart, do your thing!"
10642,Poor guy. He lost his leg.
10643,"This is my year, Marge. Everyone knows I'm what makes this city great."
10644,Wha...?!
10645,Who are you?
10646,Everyone gets an award but me.
10647,"Oh, why won't anyone give me an award?"
10648,I mean an award that's worth winning.
10649,"What's that, sonny?"
10650,"Well, that was a great night for us all."
10651,Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
10652,"Look at me, I'm a billionaire!"
10653,And the bed never needs to be made. Check it out.
10654,Wasteful AND practical.
10655,"A mechanical dressing dealy! Watch this, Marge."
10656,Now I'm ready to hit the town.
10657,I'm drunk!
10658,Look how loud I have to yell!
10659,"Why, Marge, I believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it."
10660,"Oops, forgot to swirl it."
10661,"Jimmy is such an ugly word, Marge. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits."
10662,"Listen, I worked long and hard for this place. And no one's going to take it away from me. Not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody."
10663,And another thing: If I ev...
10664,"Operator, get me Thailand. T...i... and so on."
10665,"Everybody. I found Burnsie's address book. I called the New York Yankees and told them to bunt, and then I called the Queen of England and asked her how it was going, and then I..."
10666,"Just a second, Marge. Hello! Thailand? How's everything on your end? Uh-huh. That's some language you got there. And you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?"
10667,Hey!
10668,"Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge."
10669,"Marge, you're right. We do have to have a party."
10670,What about partays?
10671,Damn!
10672,And I looked so good on that box.
10673,"Havin' a party, Moe. I'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer."
10674,"Mmmm, Danish."
10675,"Huh? If you can't sell beer, what are Lenny and Carl doing here?"
10676,But I need that beer now.
10677,"What's that, a theme park?"
10678,"They were so drunk. Gentlemen, get off your knees. Your rich uncle Homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!"
10679,And you're invited.
10680,"Marge, you know I normally listen to you, but I've gotta seize this opportunity. Just in case I never become a real billionaire."
10681,Woo hoo!
10682,Propellers... SPINNING! Turn... LEFT! Boat go... THERE!
10683,Ships ahoy!
10684,"Well done, Mr. Lenny. Well done."
10685,"We made it, son. International waters -- the land that law forgot."
10686,That's right. See that ship over there?
10687,"They're rebroadcasting Major League Baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! Or so the legend goes."
10688,There are no laws. We can do anything we want! Anything!
10689,"Ow, ow! Oh, real mature, Lenny."
10690,Look at those poor saps back on land. With their laws and ethics. They'll never know the simple joys of a monkey knife fight.
10691,"C'mon, Bart. The Coast Guard is covering the Doobs!"
10692,Who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!
10693,Pirates! Are you friendly pirates?
10694,What have you done with my party guests?
10695,Third best for me.
10696,"Help, pirates!"
10697,"Oh, bless you!"
10698,"Oh, that would be just... You're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?"
10699,I don't wanna!
10700,Ah ha! Prepare to die!
10701,You too.
10702,Agh! Rope burns!
10703,"Oooh, oooh, Charlie horse, Charlie horse!"
10704,"Agh, my mouth!"
10705,"In the net, right?"
10706,"Shut up, Net Face."
10707,"I said shut up, Net Face!"
10708,Ahhhh!
10709,That was my plan all along. Now relax and the currents will take us home.
10710,"They're the greatest heroes of all. Hey, something's clawing at my leg. Okay, it stopped."
10711,"Uh, Mr. Burns, pirates got your yacht."
10712,"I don't know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump."
10713,"That's right. Just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... Oh, I can't even finish. I wanna be rich!"
10714,"Like these guys. And look at all these rich people here. Not as rich as they should be of course. But still rich. All that big money. Look at all of these. Got all this money. I have lots of money. Oh look at all the other people. Oh, look at all the people who can buy and sell me. I should send a list of these names to the IRS. I'm takin' 'em all down. Oh, look at all the rich people. Oh, look at the rich..."
10715,"Don't shush me, you rich bastards!"
10716,Good luck gettin' a horse to eat dog food.
10717,Vietnam Veteran.
10718,"I.D.? Man, Charlie didn't ask for I.D. when I fought at La Choy and Chun King. I saw my best friend's head explode at Margaret Cho."
10719,"Why should I? Did my country give me a parade? No, man! They spat at me and..."
10720,Thanks. This closes the saddest chapter in American history.
10721,"It's B.T.O.! They're Canada's answer to E.L.P. Their big hit was ""T.C.B."" That's how we talked in the '70s. We didn't have a moment to spare."
10722,Takin' Care of Business!
10723,"No talking! No new crap! ""Takin' Care of Business!"" Now!"
10724,"Get to the ""workin' overtime"" part!"
10725,Work out!
10726,"Play ""Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!"""
10727,What-everrr!
10728,I stand by my disappointed groan.
10729,"Look, Lisa. It glows. Oooo."
10730,"See, Marge? I told you they could deep-fry my shirt."
10731,Anybody care what this guy thinks?
10732,Tunnel!
10733,"But he'll bring us joy, Marge. Unlike all your silly gewgaws."
10734,"Marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. But don't worry, I have a way for Duncan to earn his keep."
10735,"Mmm, that's terrific, Duncan. You're ten for ten. Now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the NFL."
10736,"Pearls, eh?"
10737,Huh?
10738,"Racehorse, eh?"
10739,"Son, I learned everything I needed to know from ""The Horse Whisperer"". Step One: Seduce a lonely housewife."
10740,Ma'am.
10741,Now for the actual horse whispering.
10742,"When the race starts, run really fast!"
10743,"Champion horse, coming through!"
10744,Good horse. Here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.
10745,"Hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?"
10746,"Hey, what's with the attitude? I just want some dealies."
10747,He ran all the way here.
10748,"You can do it, Duncan. I don't care if your odds are... Five million to one!?"
10749,"That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come."
10750,"Cheer up, son. I thought you looked damn good out there. Oh, wait. You were number ""5""? Eew! You stin... Damn good."
10751,"Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
10752,"Not anymore. Ladies, say hello to..."
10753,Possessions are fleeting.
10754,Woo hoo! In your little faces!
10755,"Man, I got more trophies than Wayne Gretzky and the Pope combined."
10756,I've been waiting all my life to hear that.
10757,"Hey, where'd you go?... Little man?"
10758,What happened?!
10759,What is this place?!
10760,Why are you talking like that?
10761,But you're respected athletes! You own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.
10762,What do you want me to do?
10763,MY HORSE MUST LOSE?
10764,AND WHAT IF I REFUSE TO LOSE?
10765,MY HORSE MUST LOSE!
10766,Did that really happen? Or was it just a wonderful dream?
10767,"Son, don't ask why, but you have to lose the big race."
10768,"Oh, it is, it is. But we've been pushing that poor horse too hard."
10769,"Well, it is a good life, believe me... All right, we'll give it a shot. I'll deal with those murderous trolls."
10770,"I mean, I'll deal with those murderous trolls."
10771,"Go, son! Do it for the normals!"
10772,I can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. And furthermore...
10773,Hollywood-is-leading-our-kids-down-a-moral-sewer-Gotta-go!
10774,"Nah, we're cool."
10775,"Marge, now!"
10776,"Son, go get me a trash bag."
10777,"Now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies."
10778,"Yeah, she's the best. Ooo, can you imagine her face on her body?"
10779,But what if I have to do my business?
10780,How come bears can crap in the woods and I can't?
10781,Bees!
10782,"Okay, nobody panic. There's plenty of spray for me."
10783,"No they didn't. They just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit."
10784,See? Animals can get used to anything.
10785,"Better do what he says, Marge."
10786,We can hike anytime. This is our chance to see cars driving.
10787,Flanders? Since when do you like anything cool?
10788,"Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes."
10789,"Oh, I missed one!"
10790,"Let's go! New tires! C'mon, c'mon!"
10791,"Oh, how rude of me. My name is..."
10792,My bad.
10793,Finally!
10794,I need a shirt! Gimme a shirt!
10795,"That's a damn lie, and you know it! Gimme a shirt!"
10796,"Hey, T-shirt- T-shirt-T-shirt!"
10797,"Oooh, a bobby pin."
10798,"And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. Well, from now on I'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much I love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. Maybe just a pat on the butt. Yeah, that works."
10799,I know. No more being a jerk.
10800,Finally.
10801,Quit hogging Flanders. I want to comfort him.
10802,Then I insist on walking you home.
10803,"Those feelings are normal, Ned. They're part of the process. Watch the sprinkler."
10804,"It's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkler is gone. It's time to let go."
10805,"I know, I know. It's never easy."
10806,You want anything else? Water? Chili fries? How about some white noise?
10807,"Sleep tight, Neddie."
10808,"What the... Oh, you want a rock fight, eh?"
10809,"Okay, be right down."
10810,"Yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said ""I love you,"" or ""you're special."" You know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack."
10811,"Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the one who drove her out of her seat. I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation..."
10812,"But, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game."
10813,"Easy answer, eh?"
10814,"Oh, yeah. That's it, baby, that's the money shot. Yeah, the camera loves you. Oh-ho-ho, you tease, you."
10815,You'll see...
10816,I think it's pretty obvious that I don't.
10817,"Okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of Flanders paying his bills..."
10818,Then we star-wipe to Flanders brushing his...
10819,Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?
10820,"So, how're you doing, Ned?"
10821,"Well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape..."
10822,"Now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of Maggie being born that I couldn't get rid of... Anyway, enjoy."
10823,"Single women of Springfield, your prayers have been Flanswered."
10824,"Ned Flanswered, that is."
10825,Shush.
10826,What would you say about a man who owns his own house...
10827,And his own car? That's Ned Flanders.
10828,A man who's not afraid to cry.
10829,"Hey, Ned."
10830,Yeah.
10831,Ned does everything with class. Whether he's punching in his ATM code...or keeping clean in the shower...
10832,But don't take my word for it. Listen to this testimonial.
10833,So if you're tired of dating the same old losers...
10834,"...Step up to the best. Ned Flanders, the man with the chest."
10835,"Now, we'll just send this to the dating service, the chicks'll fall for you, and bam! The healing begins."
10836,"Oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. Chicks really dig sensitivity. Did you get that, Bart?"
10837,"Beautiful! And star-wipe, aaaand we're out."
10838,Hello? Mailman?
10839,"Oh, wake up, Ned. You think Maude isn't dating in heaven?"
10840,"How could she not? The place is full of eligible bachelors -- John Wayne, Tupac Shakur, Sherlock Holmes..."
10841,He sure is!
10842,"So how'd you do tonight, Romeo?"
10843,"That's right, Ned. Those floozies we married in Vegas were crazy about you."
10844,"Marge, we're trying to help Ned."
10845,"I toileth not on ye Sabbath, woman! A pox on thee."
10846,"Hey, I'm as surprised as you, but I've stumbled upon the most delicious British sit-com."
10847,"It's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. If they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker."
10848,The Mother's the voice of reason.
10849,"Hey, what the hell's going on?!"
10850,You're mad? Where's my show!?
10851,Finally.
10852,Why are you torturing me? I'm just a man.
10853,"Well, why didn't you say so?"
10854,"Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. From... anonymous."
10855,Done and done.
10856,"Eh, how're they gonna find me?"
10857,"Oh, why did I register with Insta-trace?"
10858,"Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart."
10859,"That's it, boy! Go get help!"
10860,"Okay Homer, don't panic. Let me do the talking."
10861,"Umm... It's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary."
10862,Will cash be okay?
10863,"Well, then we've got a problem. The banks are closed by now."
10864,"Maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in Springfield are simple folk. We like our cars fast, and our banks closed. Okay, fine, we'll go down there. But they're not going to be open."
10865,"Yeah, it's a real ghost town in there."
10866,"I'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please."
10867,I'll pay you later.
10868,"Uh, why, no. Uh... Everything is just..."
10869,I can't do it. I can't kill a man!
10870,Mm-mm.
10871,Mm-hmm.
10872,The Hooligans!
10873,Bingo!
10874,Sanctuary!
10875,Sanctuary!
10876,Quick! You've got to hide me from PBS! Their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the Chubb Group!
10877,Please help me! I'll do anything! I'll light a candle! I'll help with your next charity scam!
10878,"Sure, sure, Bob's your uncle. Let's just get outta here!"
10879,"Great, but why am I on a plane?"
10880,South Pacific?! I didn't agree to...
10881,Wha -- Wait! I'm no missionary! I don't even believe in Jebus! Let me out!
10882,"Oh, save me Jebus!"
10883,"Jebus, where are you?! Homer to Jebus!"
10884,Hmm... This doesn't look so bad.
10885,"Aww. Hi there, little fella."
10886,"You're leaving? Wait, what do I do here?"
10887,Done.
10888,Me Homer. Me hiding from PBS.
10889,Here you go. Knock yourself out.
10890,"Does the word ""jet-lag"" mean anything to you people? ""Jet-laggg""."
10891,"Oh, yes. Very much so."
10892,"No, I'm good."
10893,"Hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you see in all the geographical magazines?"
10894,What was that?
10895,Great. Now my testicle's got ants on it.
10896,"Thanks, sweetheart. Have a Bible. My name's Homer. What's yours?"
10897,"I'm gonna call you Lisa Junior. So, what do you do for fun around here?"
10898,"Craig and Amy, Craig and Amy. Why don't you just marry Craig and Amy?"
10899,"So, how's the TV reception here? Excellent, or...?"
10900,You don't have TV? But what will I watch while I'm sitting on the couch?
10901,"No couches either? Oh, man. I need a beer."
10902,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!"
10903,Nothin'.
10904,Here we go. Ee-yeah.
10905,Marge!
10906,"I guess so, but that first month was pretty rough."
10907,"Really? Without TV, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends."
10908,"Mmm, I can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: Bart, you're the man of the house. Lisa -- I'm promoting you to boy. Maggie's now the brainy girl. The toaster can fill in for Maggie. And Marge, you're a consultant."
10909,"Yes, boy?"
10910,Really? You're proud of me?
10911,"Oh, really? Well, if you'll excuse me, I've got some civilization to spread like butter on the English muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies..."
10912,"Well, I'm not not licking toads... Well, it's time to get to work. Humanitarian Homer Simpson, over and out."
10913,"Gather 'round, everyone! I'm going to teach you about religion."
10914,"Please, please, that's not necessary. I'm just God's messenger."
10915,"And lo, what a wondrous message it is:"
10916,"Like this, from the Book of P-salms: ""God will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. That you may bathe your feet in blood."" As true today as it was when it was written."
10917,"Now, let's open it up to some Q & A."
10918,"Yes, Lisa Junior?"
10919,"Well, not the Unitarians. If that's the one true faith, I'll eat my hat."
10920,"Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also insecure, like Barbra Streisand, before James Brolin. Oh, he's been a rock."
10921,"Oh, who am I kidding? The truth is, I'm no missionary. I work in a nuclear power plant."
10922,"Look, the point is, I want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. What you need's a little razzle dazzle. Qtoktok, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
10923,"Hey, that's great. Now let's get to work!"
10924,"Now, if ""The Flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."
10925,"Come on little friend, make a wisecrack. You know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing."
10926,Oopsie.
10927,"Friends -- when I came here one month ago, this seemed like a strange and frightening place. But now I've learned to love this island as my second..."
10928,A plane! Stop! Get me off this stinking rock!
10929,"Anyhoo, I'm about to share with you a modern-day miracle. Something that has revitalized cities from East St. Louis to Biloxi, Mississippi. The magic medicine of... casino gambling!"
10930,It could be you!
10931,"Check it out. There's Island Blackjack, Island Craps, Island Texas Hold 'em... But if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. Four sand dollars on number six, please."
10932,"So, how you doin'? Stayin' out of trouble?"
10933,Woo hoo!
10934,"Now, over here I've brewed up my favorite beverage: beer. It's mostly Dristan and holy water, but it does the job."
10935,"So have fun everybody. And who knows? Maybe you'll hit the jackpot, get off this island, and spend the rest of your days in a tropical paradise."
10936,"Oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. Now I know how Bob Stupak feels."
10937,Is everybody happyyyyy?
10938,"Oh, my God."
10939,"Oh, what happened?! I gave you a glittering Vegas, and you turned it into a skanky Atlantic City!"
10940,Because you're all terrible sinners.
10941,Since I got here. Now either grab a stone or go to Hell.
10942,"Well, I may not know much about God, but I have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for Him."
10943,"Not bad, Lisa Junior. But God's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want Him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume."
10944,"Do you hear me, Lord?! Homer's doing your work! I'm the greatest missionary of all time! Of all time!"
10945,"Oh, no! This looks like the end!"
10946,Fire! Fire!
10947,Fire!
10948,Get in! Move it! This is not a drill!
10949,"Good work, everyone. We're sure to be first in line for Duff Days."
10950,I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood.
10951,Looking for these? Dee-dee-dee.
10952,"Twist off, dammit!"
10953,Go Moe! Boo everyone else!
10954,"Ahhh, you can really taste the goat."
10955,"All right, guys. One, two, three."
10956,"Moo?! Lenny, you were supposed to be ""E""."
10957,That one.
10958,"Aw, Maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in."
10959,Just kidding. Remember my face.
10960,"Moe, the new Duff calendars are out! The ones with your picture!"
10961,"Oh, Moe. There's lots of people uglier than you. Like, you ever been to White Castle?"
10962,Caveman brow...
10963,"C'mon, Moe. Don't feel bad. There's too much emphasis on looks these days. That's why they won't let Bill Maher on TV before midnight."
10964,"Well, it's time to get some closure. Extreme closure."
10965,"Hurry, hurry up! I have to pee!"
10966,"Okay, now do Moe."
10967,"Yeah, but just for a minute. It's a funny story; I'll tell you sometime."
10968,"Oh, you dear, dear man. You're one of us beautiful people now. And your new life begins today."
10969,Yeah!
10970,Run!
10971,You're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.
10972,Whatever.
10973,"Hey, Moe. Beer me!"
10974,Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated as Moe made it seem.
10975,"You don't love me. The only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion."
10976,"That was amazing, Moe. I'm actually a little turned on."
10977,I know what you mean. Our dog had that.
10978,The one with the amulet?
10979,"What? Let me see that! ""Interior Coroner's Office. Close-up on Dr. Winslow's mangled corpse. Coroner: 'Let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'"" Yep, that does sound kinda bad."
10980,Ding-dong!
10981,Dr. Winslooooow...
10982,I am an angel from the future.
10983,You're going to die in a skydiving accident.
10984,Gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists. With sexy results.
10985,"Well, Sister Bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. With sexy results."
10986,...and only then do we find out that Professor Gallaway's half-sister is plotting to take over International Perfume and Wine.
10987,Yeah!
10988,"I'm sorry about your face, Moe."
10989,"Yeah, you were..."
10990,"Let's see... Judging from the bug build-up, we're gettin' close."
10991,What?
10992,All right! Geez...
10993,God bless Native America.
10994,"Let's go, Marge. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
10995,"Well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor? Lisa?"
10996,Sure we can't talk you into it?
10997,"Sorry, son. Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian."
10998,"HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA."
10999,Bleh. This virtual fudge tastes like crap.
11000,"Oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!"
11001,"Right, right, present. Anyway, can I get you some Soylent Green?"
11002,"Oh, here we go."
11003,"Oh, I'm tired of giving you money. Why can't you be more like Lisa?"
11004,You should've thought of that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.
11005,I'm still cool.
11006,"Well, I do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. Oh, you can."
11007,She knows what time dinner is.
11008,Searched for Lincoln's gold.
11009,Then what is his ghost protecting?
11010,... four score and four... four score and five... four score and six... four score and seven paces.
11011,I started what from a what?
11012,"Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see..."
11013,"Oops, sorry, honey."
11014,Shut up.
11015,"Marge, I did it! I found Lincoln's gold!"
11016,Huh?
11017,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy..."
11018,"That lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!"
11019,"Ah, trash night. In France, they call it ""La Nuit Des Poubelles."" In Germany, it's ""Crappenfest."""
11020,"Quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. And remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice."
11021,See? A new pacifier for Maggie.
11022,Especially when we send it to him piece by piece.
11023,"Shh, quiet."
11024,"Well, this muscle shirt's a pretty good find."
11025,"All I know is, I'm finally getting the support I need."
11026,"Hey, Vinnie, how's about a pizza? I got-a no job."
11027,Mama mia. Look what the Hawaiian restaurant threw out!
11028,Get outta my dreams and into my car.
11029,Hey Flanders? Can your God do that?
11030,I'll be at Moe's.
11031,I threw you a party at my house.
11032,"You wish. That's the stage we call ""Professor Barney"" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. Here's drunk."
11033,"Marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... Oh, it's just Barney."
11034,Disgracefully hilarious! You passed out before we could even give you your presents.
11035,"Wait a minute, Barney. You gotta be sober to fly. I mean, it's not like drivin' a car."
11036,"Barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking?"
11037,You came to the right guy. I'll straighten ya out... right after I finish this beer.
11038,"Ah, man that's sweet. Okay, let's go."
11039,Oh. My name is Homer and I'm planning a trip to St. Louis.
11040,Is there any other St. Louis?
11041,Not a chance. I can sink way lower. I just came to help my friend Barney.
11042,The sugar cookies you speak of. Are they real or symbolic?
11043,I don't wanna walk that far. Anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. Get it? Huh? Twelve? Steps.
11044,Hey? How did I get out here?
11045,But that's Barney's seat. Are you tryin' to make me the new Barney?
11046,"Well, forget it, guys. I am not Barney!"
11047,Okay...
11048,"If I didn't, I'd lose their respect."
11049,"Can I, Marge? Can I?"
11050,So you missed some big changes at Moe's. He hangs newspapers over the urinals now. You can read the sports page while you pee. Very la-di-da.
11051,Wasted? What about our staring contests? And the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? Remember the day we jumped that Census guy and stole his clicker?
11052,"Oh, so you're better than me, is that it?"
11053,Take me home.
11054,I'll scream.
11055,I don't wanna talk about it!
11056,"Stupid Barney, thinks he's too good for me."
11057,But you've got me. Who have I got?
11058,"Lenny and Carl suck. Please don't tell Lenny and Carl I said that, 'cause if I ever lost them as friends..."
11059,"Oh, why can't I have a nickname?"
11060,"Hey, Apu. You got any of those potato chips that give you diarrhea? I need to do a little ""spring cleaning."""
11061,Barney.
11062,That's right.
11063,That I will.
11064,You keep thinkin' that.
11065,Me too.
11066,"Good day, then is right."
11067,Ta-ta.
11068,"Lenny, Carl, I know a lot of people bad-mouth you, and focus on how you suck, but not me. To me, you're true blue."
11069,Okay.
11070,"Well, if it isn't Little Miss ""I'm not wasting my life anymore."" Which he is."
11071,"Oh, no! That's Bart and Lisa!"
11072,"Barney, you gotta fly us up there and save my kids!"
11073,Barney...
11074,The call is from heroism. Will you accept the charges?
11075,Where are you going? The fire's that way!
11076,Look out!
11077,"Barney, no! Don't!"
11078,No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that!
11079,"Ugh, it's warm."
11080,"Oh, yes I can!"
11081,Gimme that!
11082,"I won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. I love you. Let's not lose touch after graduation."
11083,Stay away from my wife!
11084,"Hi, kids!"
11085,Get off! Get off!
11086,"All right, I'm comin'."
11087,You can't prove I did it.
11088,I could do a lotta things if I had some money.
11089,Yeah. So what do you call this stuff?
11090,It's not bad.
11091,...And three makes three.
11092,It'll be real soon enough.
11093,"Ooh, my first issue of ""Self-Test Monthly."" Finally I get to find out what makes me tick."
11094,"Yeah, but in what ratio?"
11095,Are you a good driver?
11096,"""Yes."" ""Are you a good lover?"" ""Yes."" Oh, I'm doin' great!"
11097,My way is easier.
11098,"Quizmaster, yes... That would entertain me briefly."
11099,"Okay, Flanders, your love quiz score is 61. That makes you a ""Frigid Frieda."" I took off thirty points for all that crying you did."
11100,No way. When?
11101,"Oh, yeah. I saw a gopher. What a day!"
11102,"Okay. ""Last question: Who is your favorite Backstreet Boy?"""
11103,According to this you're both idiots.
11104,"Okay. ""There's a black widow at your door, a rattlesnake at the window, and a scorpion on the phone. Do you A) None of the below, B)..."""
11105,"Fine. I'll take the next quiz. ""How Long Will You Live?"""
11106,"""In an average week, how many braised ribs do you eat?"" Marge, do you think that counts honey-braised?"
11107,"Okay, non-smoker... add eight years. So according to this I'll live to be... 42! Oh, that's horrible! I won't even live to see my children die!"
11108,I've only got three more years to live!
11109,"See?! And these quizzes are never wrong, Marge. They're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business."
11110,No!
11111,Can't sleep. Gonna die. Can't sleep. Gonna die.
11112,"I'm not crazy. It's the TV that's crazy. Aren't you, TV?"
11113,You see? Gibberish. All gibberish.
11114,You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.
11115,A mother can't die. And I'm a mother. See?
11116,Sometimes. But the guy I really hate is your father.
11117,Why isn't my baby gaining weight?
11118,I see...
11119,Florida? But that's America's wang.
11120,My pockets hurt.
11121,Par-ty!
11122,"Well, enjoy your sightseeing. I promise I won't leave this bed."
11123,"Uh, could you just uh... shut off the..."
11124,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
11125,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
11126,"Now, this is living!"
11127,Wooo! I like mu-sic!
11128,"Oh, no, it's a lost child! Don't worry, folks. I'll tackle him."
11129,BAWITDABA / BANANA FANA / OOGA CHOCKA / ETC.
11130,Bring on the rappin' granny!
11131,What? She's hilarious.
11132,All for Homer... All for Homer...
11133,Biatch? Moi?
11134,WE BUILT THIS CITY / ON ROCK ANNND ROLL! Uh-oh.
11135,"They called you a pig, Sheriff."
11136,"Guess how many boobs I saw today, Marge? Fifteen!"
11137,Doesn't he talk funny?
11138,"My insomnia, it's gone! Check it out, Marge. I'm sane again! And I owe it all to... Spring Break!"
11139,Whoo! I'm an animal!
11140,"Hey, where is everybody?"
11141,Fine. Be nerds. I'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.
11142,WE BUILT THIS CITY / THIS KICK-ASS CITY / WHAT KIND OF MUSIC BUILT THIS CITY?
11143,LOOK OUT FOR WHAT?
11144,THE GI-ANT...
11145,You'll have to catch me first.
11146,"Okay, I'll go quietly."
11147,Look. This is our chance.
11148,Let's go!
11149,"Well, I'm gonna try anyway."
11150,It worked! It's a miracle!
11151,There's no good place!
11152,No shade!
11153,Perfect.
11154,Or die trying...
11155,"The only thing we can do. Sit tight, and try to get some sleep."
11156,"Rise and shine, everybody."
11157,"Yeah, but first I talked to the engineer. He said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature."
11158,"Okay, now am I the only one on fire? Good."
11159,I love being married.
11160,That's perfect! We can hide out here 'til the heat's off.
11161,Woo hoo!
11162,"More hashbrowns, sugar?"
11163,But I was just...
11164,...gonna try to...
11165,...knock you out...
11166,JIMMY CRACK CORN AND I DON'T CARE / JIMMY CRACK CORN AND I'M NOT THERE / WE BUILT THIS CITY ON ROCK AND ROLLLLL / SOMETHING SOMETHING DAY.
11167,"You know, killing that gator was the best decision I ever made."
11168,"Yep, this place is great. And someday, when Lisa and Bart get married, it'll all be theirs."
11169,"Okay, but I ain't payin' for two weddin's."
11170,You'd better.
11171,"Your Honor, I'd like to represent myself. Drunken hicks of the jury..."
11172,Uhh... no.
11173,"Champagne, madame?"
11174,Son of a--! And the gentleman? Damn it!
11175,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
11176,That's what we've been trying to tell you.
11177,Fine. There are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.
11178,Arizona smells funny.
11179,Poor Cyborganizer
11180,Talking while the TV's on can't be good for you.
11181,Nah. I want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.
11182,Too late.
11183,"Whee! Touch the sky, Maggie! Whee! Touch the sky!"
11184,Who said that?
11185,Sorry.
11186,I... 8... P.P.
11187,Why you little...
11188,Worse.
11189,Much better.
11190,"Oo, my favorite Door."
11191,Ew. She ruined the Plastic Ono Band.
11192,Would it get me out of having to choose glasses?
11193,"Less yappin', more zappin'."
11194,"Oh, here we go with the add ons. No thanks."
11195,"Yes, dear."
11196,"Hey, we got a postcard from Bart. ""Dear Mom and Homer. I'm having fun."" Aw, sounds like he's having fun."
11197,Didn't you ever go to camp? The ol' Vitamin Barn...
11198,"Look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes."
11199,You're Daddy's precious dancing queen!
11200,"Now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?"
11201,Oh! What's that awful sound?
11202,Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
11203,"Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!"
11204,"Go, Lisa! C'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!"
11205,"I didn't think, I just acted."
11206,"What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the ""On"" position. See? ""On."""
11207,"Oh. Ohhhhh. Well, now that I look even closer..."
11208,"That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind."
11209,"Hey, yeah. You could load it up with lots of swears. That's what David Mamet does."
11210,"Why? It's just a cute little weasel. Hello there, Mister weasel."
11211,I'm down.
11212,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
11213,I didn't hit your precious table.
11214,"Oh, that's just superstition."
11215,"In about fifteen minutes I'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy."
11216,"Yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man."
11217,Remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?
11218,It's settled. The stranger stays with us!
11219,CH-CH-CH-CHANGES / TIME TO CHANGE THE OIL / YEAH / CHANGES / DON'T WANNA BE AN OILY MAN /
11220,What are these things in the mashed potatoes?
11221,"No! Oh, Becky, your potatoes are the best I've ever had."
11222,"Oh, God."
11223,Take your time!
11224,"Becky, I think I speak for all of us when I say ""When's the ice cream gonna get here?"""
11225,"Run, Marge, run! Pump those crazy legs!"
11226,"Don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. To finish off Becky. Then we'll have Mommy back."
11227,"I heard she mates with men, then eats them."
11228,"Oh, about that. Uh -- when I changed your oil, I may have drained your brake fluid. I didn't say anything 'cause I thought you'd be mad."
11229,You monsters! You've killed her!
11230,Thank you.
11231,Everybody wanted a piece of us.
11232,"Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV. That's how I was raised, and I turned out TV."
11233,"Our favorite show was ""Hollywood Hogwash."" But we also loved ""The Dreck Squad""..."
11234,But we never saw people like us on TV.
11235,"""My Funny Family,"" take one."
11236,Aannnd action!
11237,"Honey, I'm home! The boss is coming to dinner and I need a clean shirt."
11238,Mamma mia! Now I'll have to do it.
11239,Not now. I'm busy turning on this washing machine.
11240,Mamma mia!
11241,"Every day I thought about firing Marge. You know, just to shake things up."
11242,...M-E-R. Okay.
11243,You're almost there.
11244,Good.
11245,"Son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes."
11246,Why you little...!
11247,And that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.
11248,I want to set the record straight. I thought the cop was a prostitute.
11249,"Hello, Mister Lobster."
11250,Everything was goin' great at first. I felt like I was king of the world.
11251,I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!
11252,"Right about here, I realize something's wrong."
11253,"Yep, there I go. Then came the rocks. Jagged rocks. Hitting me with their jags."
11254,"Oh, my leg! This is the worst pain ever! Stop pummeling me! It's really painful! Owww!"
11255,Why did I take such punishment? Let's just say that fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
11256,"Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there."
11257,"Ohhhh, Mister. Porky."
11258,Who told you about those laws? Was it Marge?
11259,"Helloooo, Iowa! Does anyone have a donut?"
11260,"No, something that rocks. That's the sound of today."
11261,Rocks!
11262,I'll kill you!
11263,"Hey, hey, stop it!"
11264,Who are you! I'll get you!
11265,"That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. It gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. I returned to my first love, the legitimate theater."
11266,"WHERE IS THE RENT? / I MUST HAVE THE RENT! / DOLLARS, DIMES AND NICKELS / I NEED THEM ALL RIGHT NOW!"
11267,I literally chewed the scenery.
11268,That's ridiculous! How could I even get all five necessary drops into her cereal?
11269,What?
11270,"So, uh, how's everybody doing?"
11271,"It was the best Thanksgiving ever. I mean, emotionally, it was terrible. But the turkey was so moist."
11272,Hi!
11273,What?! What's she doing here?
11274,"Yes, go on."
11275,"We put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the Sunday comic strip."
11276,Why you little...!
11277,The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
11278,This'll be the last season.
11279,"Hey, who cut out Beetle Bailey? I need my Miss Buxley fix."
11280,"Eh, too much baggage. Oo, my horoscope. Taurus: ""Today you will die."""
11281,... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker! Lenny?
11282,"Ooo, scary newspaper. Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid of..."
11283,"Ow! Oooh! Paper cut, paper cut!"
11284,Missed me! Stupid horoscope!
11285,Stupid horoscope!
11286,Cloopid blore-apope!
11287,"Nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. Snakes: nature's quitters."
11288,"That horoscope was baloney. Nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. What's for dessert?"
11289,Fine.
11290,"St. Peter! Woo hoo! Got to heaven before you, Flanders!"
11291,"Well, the thing about that is..."
11292,"I'm sorry, I didn't get the number of hours or good deeds."
11293,"Let's see, good deed..."
11294,... Gotta find a good deed.
11295,Bingo!
11296,Woo hoo!
11297,Did you see that? I did the deed! Open up!
11298,"Hey, I thought you guys could see everything."
11299,Well I'll be damned.
11300,I am Hooomer Siiimpsonnn...
11301,Oh no!
11302,"Hello, Wife! Hello, children!"
11303,Who's up for a merry jig?
11304,"Oh, who am I kidding? I'm not merry."
11305,I lost my job as an oaf today.
11306,Really?
11307,Whaddaya think? Do you love it?
11308,"Oh, I'm no dunce. I was born an oaf, and I'll die an oaf."
11309,Don't worry. No child will ever starve in my home.
11310,"So long, kids. Enjoy your new home! Say hi to your other brother and sister."
11311,"Boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty."
11312,Here's a better idea -- I know how we can replace those children.
11313,Son? Daughter? I'm ever so sorry.
11314,"Mmm, sugar walls."
11315,"Oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... It's all good."
11316,"Oh, that's all you got? Huh? Huh?"
11317,"Mmmm, fish. Oh no, that's me!"
11318,Almost. Just give her another twenty minutes.
11319,Comin' up!
11320,"... Two Krusty shakes, a donut burger with cheese and a party-size bucket of flan."
11321,"Yes, I will have fries with that."
11322,Anything to get out of work.
11323,Intelligent Italians? Something's wrong.
11324,Hmm. Phone's off the hook. Everything must be okay.
11325,"It was her, all right. Take the one who wronged you."
11326,"Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!"
11327,Uh-oh.
11328,"Hey, leave my daughter alone! C'mon, humans! We've wiped out entire species before. We can do it again!"
11329,C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!
11330,"Hey, you gotta hand it to those dolphins. They just wanted it more."
11331,Television broken?
11332,"Badger, my ass. It's probably Milhouse."
11333,Milhouse? Milhouse?
11334,"It's a badger all right... Or possibly a griffin. Bart, do you have any dynamite in your room?"
11335,Get it.
11336,Great idea. Then we should call the doctor about this.
11337,"What am I, a tailor?"
11338,Area code? But it's a local call.
11339,"939?! What the hell is that? Oh, my life is ruined."
11340,"Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge."
11341,Go away. We've got bigger problems now.
11342,"I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm gonna call the newspapers, the TV stations, the gas stations, everybody."
11343,I hate this new area code. Like I don't have enough to remember already.
11344,"Don't you miss the old 636, Carl?"
11345,What really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.
11346,Not a single word of warning.
11347,Joan Collins? That girl sleeps with everybody!
11348,The Who? I love bands!
11349,That's my number!
11350,"Hey, that's not me!"
11351,"It's not fair! I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys."
11352,Good idea.
11353,Why you little...
11354,How the hell did they find that out?
11355,"Uh, I have a question, Phoney."
11356,"Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question."
11357,Wait a minute! We haven't heard from me yet. The nut with the dynamite. The phone company is bamboozling you!
11358,I accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose!
11359,"Now, I'm not one to make trouble... but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old, or ""classic"" 636 area code, lives on... the rich side of town!"
11360,"And as usual, we Joe Twelve-Packs get the royal screw job."
11361,"Well, I've had it! You rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore!"
11362,"Well, I..."
11363,"Nice wiring, Bart."
11364,"Okay, Plan B. Fellow 9-3-9'ers, I say we break off and form our own city!"
11365,Now who's stupid?
11366,There. We're officially a city. Now we just sit back and wait for an NFL franchise.
11367,Keep walkin'
11368,"Mayor, eh?"
11369,"I reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job."
11370,New Springfield rocks!
11371,Oh yeah? What is it?
11372,Damnit!
11373,Read my lips: Yes.
11374,No problem.
11375,Stop right there.
11376,"Sweetie, you know your mother and I only stay together for the sake of my political career."
11377,Big grins!
11378,That'll play great in the sticks.
11379,"Oh, that was fifty already?"
11380,"Hey, the TV man is talking about us!"
11381,"Oh yeah? They think they're better than us, huh? Bart, c'mere a minute."
11382,Oh yeah?
11383,"Thank you, Marge. Now, let's see how Olde Snobfield does without electricity."
11384,Woo hoo!
11385,"Those rich, snobby Indians."
11386,Woo hoo! Flood from water!
11387,You're right. We've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.
11388,Good idea. We should call the guys they used.
11389,It's ringing.
11390,And I'd like to thank Low Ball Construction for building this amazing wall... From ninety percent recycled materials.
11391,"Loyal citizens of New Springfield. You stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all."
11392,"Don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. And then a wave of disease should help to -- hey!"
11393,Stop streaming over the wall! At least wait till I'm through talking.
11394,"Okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible..."
11395,I can't believe all those rats fled my town.
11396,Guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.
11397,I can't believe those traitors abandoned us. They couldn't take one lousy famine.
11398,No problem.
11399,"Anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back..."
11400,We've got the Who playing here tonight.
11401,"Hey, maybe we could. But we'll need some liquid persuasion."
11402,"C'mon, Bart. We're gonna bring back The Who."
11403,Uh...
11404,"Huh? Oh, right."
11405,I'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to The Who.
11406,"Wow, The Who!"
11407,Woo! Rock 'n' roll!
11408,"Whatever. The point is, I'm Homer Simpson."
11409,That's right.
11410,"That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City."
11411,"C'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant Who of ""My Generation,"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and ""Mama's Got a Squeeze Box""?"
11412,"But those Olde Springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like Keith Partridge."
11413,Somethin' wrong with your legs?
11414,"Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town."
11415,Now these are the tunes I want you boys to play.
11416,"Oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""Pacman Fever / A do do do do / It's driving me crazy."" Look Lisa, Daddy's in the Who!"
11417,"So, New Springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? With our ample parking and daily Who concerts."
11418,We'll talk.
11419,Ha-ha. You hit the tire fire! You'll have to do...
11420,Why me?
11421,Magic Bus!
11422,Pinball Wizard!
11423,"Well Marge, looks like your insane experiment is over."
11424,This watermelon won't know what hit it.
11425,"Yeah, we're heroes... But where's our parade?"
11426,"All right. ""Open stuck drawer..."" All-righty."
11427,"Eh, it's hopeless."
11428,"Yeah, it's hopeless."
11429,"I said, it's... Ohhh..."
11430,"Listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?"
11431,"Oh, don't worry. You'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. Target date: January, 2007."
11432,"And now, the grand finale... ""Get Lisa's jammed tape out of VCR."""
11433,"Oop, wait a minute..."
11434,There.
11435,Fire in the hole!
11436,Hmm. It's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.
11437,"Uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room."
11438,"Oh Lisa, this must be a rough time for you. Do you have any friends or family you can stay with?"
11439,"Oh, come on. Tell us how we can make it up to you. Hey, pretend it's your birthday."
11440,Anything at all. You name it. What do you want to do?
11441,Stupid Lisa.
11442,okay.
11443,Idiots.
11444,"Dear Lord, bless this humble meal, and did you hear about Krusty? Whoa, man! I mean, I knew he was a player, but geez, a kid?"
11445,"Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters. So, how's Maude Flanders doin' up there? She playin' the field? Ooh... yeah, really? All those guys? Amen."
11446,"Okay, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey."
11447,"Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Except for some mag wheels. Oh, man, that would be sweet."
11448,"Just a second, honey. Daddy's on his high horse."
11449,"Yeah, I'm watching, honey. Nice cannonball. Anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'Cause over-thinking is... What were we talking about? Ooh, a clown."
11450,My uncle still has my nose.
11451,Can we make this hand high-low?
11452,I fold.
11453,"A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A WEEMA-WAY, A-WEEM..."
11454,"Maybe so, but Dawson's gonna be bummed."
11455,"Marge, may I play devil's advocate for a moment?"
11456,C'mon! Get in there!
11457,"Stupid game! Now, what were we talking about?"
11458,"Oh, right. Why don't we just break into Fat Tony's compound and get it back?"
11459,For a casual acquaintance like you? Absolutely.
11460,"This is perfect! If I know Fat Tony, which I don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. Come on."
11461,That violin's gotta be around here somewhere.
11462,I have a plan.
11463,"Well, that didn't work."
11464,I think we're in the clear.
11465,I said I was sorry.
11466,"Sorry you're such jerks! Ha, ha!"
11467,Ow! That Bullet went in.
11468,"You want money? Get a job, like your old man."
11469,"So, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?"
11470,I like your attitude. Take what you need.
11471,"No, of course not."
11472,"Take that, Lisa's beliefs."
11473,I knew this day would come. The cows are taking back what's theirs.
11474,"Look, Marge! I'm in a limo! The Simpsons are going to Paris!"
11475,Bor-ing!
11476,"Ah, the Luftwaffe. The Washington Generals of the History Channel."
11477,"First comes love, then comes, um... Dammit, I know this."
11478,Have a good time at your hippie club.
11479,"No, I like to save the environment in my own way."
11480,Mmm... donuts.
11481,"Sheesh, look at these refugees. How 'bout a smile?"
11482,"Well, moping won't make it better."
11483,"Marge, she's gonna narc on our stash."
11484,"This is your fault, with your non-threatening Bobby Sherman-style good looks. No girl could resist your charms."
11485,"I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. I was lost in your eyes."
11486,You call that saying grace?!
11487,"Oh no, Lisa's gone! And nothing will bring her back. Unless..."
11488,"Oh, praise God, you're alive! Unless..."
11489,"Oh, must hide Lisa...!"
11490,Come i-in!
11491,"Grieving father, comin' through..."
11492,"Thanks for the beer, Moe. But before Lisa died, she made this tape that I think you should hear."
11493,Read it!
11494,"Oh, here we go."
11495,Nooo! It was finger Ling-Ling good!
11496,"Well, what do you want, a medal?"
11497,Love you.
11498,"No, really."
11499,"Oh, how embarrassing. Well, let me just give you one of my many other valid..."
11500,Run!
11501,"Okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. What are you gonna do about it?"
11502,Can we go now?
11503,Fine. You want passion? I'll give you passion.
11504,BLUE SPANISH EYES / TEARDROPS ARE FALLING FROM YOUR SPANISH EYES...
11505,I think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
11506,I had to sell it for gas money.
11507,Which I spent on a novelty horn.
11508,"Financial panther, eh?"
11509,"Get him, Sheeba!"
11510,I'm on board.
11511,"Just give the word, and I'll cut him off."
11512,Consider it done.
11513,"Marge, your posture looks terrible."
11514,"Yes, go on..."
11515,But how do I get it?
11516,I'm just trying to work up the courage to ask Burns for a raise. Or a highly-paid internship. Something to solve my money woes.
11517,That's the sneeze guard. You have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
11518,Mr. Burns... I was wondering if I could get a raise.
11519,Whopping?
11520,"Well, sir... you see, sir... I've worked here a long time, and my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as well..."
11521,"A laugh? Okay, let's see, what's in the news today?..."
11522,At Lenny? But he's a war hero!
11523,No!
11524,Okay.
11525,I liked when I threw the pudding.
11526,You're the boss.
11527,Will you keep giving me money?
11528,Woo hoo!
11529,"I'd like to buy a mint condition ""Spider-Man Number One,"" please."
11530,"Uh, no thanks. I'll just eat it here."
11531,Do I get paid now?
11532,Little help?
11533,"Little help, please? I made a boom-boom..."
11534,Baby made a boom-boom.
11535,"Here you are, my good man. And while you're at it, throw in one of those polio shots."
11536,Anti-polio.
11537,I've been doing some outside projects for Mr. Burns.
11538,"Oh, y'know, business stuff... downsizing, e-solutions, the glass ceiling..."
11539,"Well, why do I have to do the Lindy Hop?"
11540,Can't take the pain...
11541,Huh? Help! Mr. Burns!
11542,Am I glad to see you guys. You gotta call...
11543,Did you see Daddy dance? They all saw me dance.
11544,Yes. I humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
11545,I know.
11546,Maybe for you. How come you didn't rescue me?
11547,"Well, you could treat me with a little respect."
11548,"You see, that's what I'm saying."
11549,"Shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey."
11550,"She's right. Yes, I may be naked and reeking of panda love, but I've got to stop this before it goes too far."
11551,I retract my statement.
11552,"I mean, screw you!"
11553,"Huh? Oh, why did he have to say that extra thing?"
11554,"Aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should I do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? I better throw it in the garbage."
11555,I see what you're saying -- I need to buy a gun.
11556,You're right. It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.
11557,"Hey, what happened to...?"
11558,"Excuse me, sir."
11559,"I'd like to buy all these toys for some needy children. Is this enough dirty, dirty money?"
11560,I'm just tryin' to dig myself out of a pit of shame.
11561,It's okay.
11562,"I don't need to rehearse. Ho, ho, ho, Merry... Line!"
11563,What? Lemme see that.
11564,"Ho, ho, ho, Merry Everyone!"
11565,What are you doing here? I told you I'm not your monkey anymore.
11566,"The answer is no, Mr. Burns. Not for any amount of money."
11567,"Oh, so much money..."
11568,But Santa can't be evil...
11569,But it's so much money.
11570,"Not yet, honey."
11571,Let's just say Lisa gave me an early Christmas present. The gift of dignity.
11572,Baby made a boom-boom.
11573,"Hey, open up! I've been standing here all morning."
11574,No one told me the plant was closed!
11575,What's an e-mail?
11576,I don't have a computer.
11577,That does it. I'm getting a computer! As soon as somebody lets me outta here!
11578,Oh. I'm so stupid.
11579,Uh... I guess I'll take that one.
11580,"Well, a paperweight would be nice, but what I really need is a computer. How about that one?"
11581,"Heavens, no!"
11582,I just need something to receive e-mail.
11583,I was an astronaut.
11584,Five thousand dollars!
11585,"This is the best computer in the world and always will be, right?"
11586,"Hey Lisa, check out my new computer!"
11587,That's right! Top of the line!
11588,"Stupid pothole. Don't worry, head. The computer will do our thinking now."
11589,"Oh, yeah... perfect. Now then..."
11590,Computer... kill Flanders.
11591,Good start! Now finish the job!
11592,$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
11593,You're it!
11594,Hmmmmm.
11595,Fine!
11596,"Ooh, a dancing Jesus. De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de. If there's a better use for the Internet, I haven't found it."
11597,Hey!
11598,"Here it is, everybody! The world's greatest website!"
11599,"You'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not."
11600,"No kiddin'. What do you think of my page, Lisa? Be honest. It's great, isn't it? Go ahead and say it's great if you want to."
11601,They can't sue me if they don't know who I am. I'll just call myself Mr. X.
11602,"Yep, you can't go wrong with Mr. X."
11603,I can't. My web page hasn't gotten a single hit.
11604,Come on.
11605,That lousy pothole! Why don't they fix it?
11606,Get out! Who told you that?
11607,"Hmm, that's the kind of dirt that belongs on my web page."
11608,"Nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. Nelson is gold."
11609,Beautiful. We have confirmation.
11610,I did it. I changed the world. Now I know exactly how God feels.
11611,Bring me two of every animal.
11612,Darn tootin'.
11613,No way! Mr. X is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!
11614,What a bombshell!
11615,"Oh, I don't know, Carl. He might be closer than you think."
11616,No!
11617,I am not. Or am I?
11618,No!
11619,"Hey, Moe, can you keep a secret?"
11620,Not even a little one?
11621,What if I just whisper it?
11622,I'VE BEEN SITTIN' ON THE TOILET / ALL THE LIVE-LONG DAY...
11623,I love spying.
11624,"And who's selling the uranium to the terrorists? Montgomery Burns. Now, we wait."
11625,Whoa... He's in trouble.
11626,Nooo!
11627,I'm Mr. X! Gimme! Gimme!
11628,"Thank you, folks. And now I'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and..."
11629,I bit my tongue!
11630,Finally.
11631,They're with God now.
11632,"Hey, guys. How's it goin'?"
11633,"Oh, don't worry about the Mr. X thing. I'm just here for a beer."
11634,I smell another Pulitzer.
11635,Nobody's visiting my web page anymore. My counter is actually going down.
11636,That's a great idea! I'll make up some news!
11637,"Let's see now... ""BULLETIN: New Race Discovered Living Six Inches Under... Denver."""
11638,All Named 'Morton'... or... 'Mortonson'...
11639,"Real news is great, son. But I'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-A bull plop."
11640,"Gimme a hundred Lotto tickets, Apu. Because Mr. X is on a roll."
11641,"Stop it, Apu. You're scaring me."
11642,What's going on?
11643,"Help, I'm being kidnapped!"
11644,"Save me, Mr. X! Wait, I'm Mr. X."
11645,Wuzzah?
11646,What the hell?
11647,How did I get here? What is this place?
11648,How do I get outta here?
11649,So I'm a prisoner? How come?
11650,But I don't know anything. At least I don't think I do.
11651,No you won't!
11652,"Hello, operator? I'd like to report a really weird island. Please send lots of rescue copters to..."
11653,"All right, whatever."
11654,"I am not a number, I am a man. And don't you ever... Oh, wait, I'm Number 5. Ha ha! In your face, Number 6!"
11655,Who are all these oddballs?
11656,Wow.
11657,"So, who brought us here?"
11658,Did you bring us here?
11659,"Oh, they drugged the tea. They knew my one weakness."
11660,Who are you and why are you holding me here? I want answers now or I want them eventually.
11661,Sorry.
11662,That's impossible. All my stories are bull plop. Bull plop!
11663,But why?
11664,"Of course! It's so simple... Wait, no it's not. It's needlessly complicated."
11665,"No, sir."
11666,"Look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse."
11667,I'm sorry. What?
11668,I'm tired of being drugged and gagged. There's gotta be a way to escaped.
11669,Huh?
11670,"Oh, no! An anti-escape orb!"
11671,"Huh, that was easy."
11672,What a horrible four months. Now to warn everybody.
11673,Attention: some crazy creeps on an island somewhere are secretly running the world...
11674,Hey!
11675,Huh?
11676,"Not a chance. No one can silence me, but me!"
11677,Whuh?
11678,"If I know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch."
11679,"Oh, Marge. It's me, the real Homer!"
11680,Absolutely.
11681,The dog thinks so...
11682,Bad dog.
11683,"Oh, it's wonderful."
11684,Truly God's country.
11685,See you on the island.
11686,"Okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding."
11687,Wait a minute...
11688,Beer! Yes! How did you know?
11689,He's very good.
11690,So she was made of chimps.
11691,"Gee, I wish I could, son, but we've already left the gift shop."
11692,What the hell is that?!
11693,I know that. How much to fix it?
11694,I can't afford that.
11695,He couldn't breathe.
11696,Step right up! See the magic boy! Witness mystifying feats that will leave you scratching your head until it's raw and bloody!
11697,"Come on, pony up, Flanders. The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'."
11698,Black arts?!
11699,"Okay, we'll move. We don't want any trouble, fellas."
11700,"I know, but which one?"
11701,Sixty cents?! I would've made more if I'd gone into work today!
11702,A good son would come through for his dad!
11703,I told you! I find them boring.
11704,"Oh, that's it! You can walk home!"
11705,"Stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car."
11706,What the?!
11707,Is that a steak?
11708,Who gave you all this money?
11709,"Really. Hey, maybe we could do that again. Can you look even more pathetic?"
11710,"Oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! We could make a fortune."
11711,"Well, yeah. But God conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs."
11712,There ya go! We'd be stealing from people we know. It's just like the seasons.
11713,I think you know the answer to that.
11714,They have any father-and-son grifts?
11715,Interesting.
11716,I could ask you the very same question.
11717,Would you?
11718,You bet. Let's trim the mark.
11719,"Ten-four, Kemosabe."
11720,"What have you done, you clumsy little ox?! That cake was for your deaf sister!"
11721,"No, no. Don't protect him. You'll work off that cake in the acid mines."
11722,"Well, you're the mark."
11723,... of integrity.
11724,"A singing rubber fish, of course."
11725,What in the hell are you talking about?
11726,"Oh, right, the magic. The magic was great. It's really... the way to go."
11727,Suckers.
11728,Dog for sale!
11729,Dog for sale!
11730,"Oh, he's not for sale."
11731,Although if the right offer came along...
11732,"Here's for the repairs, and a little extra for you."
11733,"Yes, son?"
11734,In a way. But I also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. Plus the baldness.
11735,"Hello, is the lady of the house in?"
11736,"Oh, of course, of course. It's just that..."
11737,"Well, before she died, she ordered this Bible especially for you."
11738,"Now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man..."
11739,We'll be safe here.
11740,Dad?
11741,How'd you get wise to us?
11742,"So what's the pitch, old man?"
11743,Oh... my... God.
11744,Let's dust a few fossils.
11745,Which one of you youngsters is Abe Simpson?
11746,You've just won 10 million dollars from that Publisher's Cleary-dealie!
11747,He's dead.
11748,I guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. Too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
11749,You're right. We'd better just take this check back for shredding.
11750,"Thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... Is that everyone?"
11751,"What's your problem, Sport? Afraid to be rich?"
11752,So we're under arrest for fraud?
11753,"Thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting."
11754,"Yeah. We're not criminals. We're just two crazy, mixed-up kids."
11755,You'd do that for us?
11756,"Okay, thank you, sir."
11757,"Don't worry, son. I have an idea."
11758,"Chief, I'd like to scare my son straight. Could I show him a jail cell?"
11759,Yeah. Ya big idiot...
11760,Colgate Cavity Patrol?
11761,"Yeah, he conned us good. Well, at least we still have our jobs at the sweepstakes place."
11762,What?
11763,"Lies got us into this mess, son. From now on it's honesty all the way."
11764,"Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... Bart, would you call him a crazy man?"
11765,"Well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some..."
11766,"Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly."
11767,"Anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. Let's hit the hay."
11768,Huh? But that's impossible.
11769,Uh-oh.
11770,"Well, look at that. But who called the police?"
11771,"'Course he did, son. He's a filthy crook. Now, let's all hit the hay."
11772,I guess you haven't heard of chloroform.
11773,Let's see how this plays out.
11774,"I told you, my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!"
11775,"Yes, exactly! No, no! I mean, the whole incident is hazy."
11776,"Yes, exactly!"
11777,Hey? Mountain Dew?!
11778,When the time is right...
11779,Let's see where he's going with this...
11780,Stop! This has gone on just long enough.
11781,Nobody carjacked me. I tried to pull a con and got conned myself. And then I lied to you all! So did Bart.
11782,But Skinner got shot!
11783,But what about the guy who took my car?
11784,I can't believe everyone was in on it.
11785,"Wait a minute. You're telling me the police force, the TV news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and Bart a lesson?"
11786,"Heh, heh, heh. Tremendous."
11787,"Lenny, are you watching this?"
11788,I know!
11789,Circus?
11790,But I wanna watch Bret Favre!
11791,I missed one of Jerry's zingers. Now I'll never catch up.
11792,"Oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement."
11793,I wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
11794,Just smash it open!
11795,Oh no you don't! I paid full price for this freak show. Now nourish the child within me! Nourish...
11796,"One snow angel, comin' up."
11797,"Ahh, why does that always happen?"
11798,Man -- everyone has a snow day but us.
11799,I 'unno... Internet?
11800,"My car, your roof. It's only fair."
11801,"Well, yeah."
11802,"I think I know my own life, Ned."
11803,CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS / MR. PLOW.
11804,"I hope it's Flanders. I'm just kidding. Hey, you're all right."
11805,... I FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE / MAKIN' LOVE TO YOU! / DO DO DOOO / DO DO DOOO.
11806,"Yeah, as a tribute to Princess Di. And Dodi. Because these days, princesses..."
11807,"Wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles."
11808,Marvelous! Marvelous! Enough! I grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.
11809,Bring me my ranch-dressing hose.
11810,"I know, ranch dressing."
11811,A hamster ball!
11812,We're free! And we've got something to eat.
11813,Woo hoo!
11814,You're the camel.
11815,"Hey, this car's got cruise control."
11816,"School, please."
11817,Do you have airbags?
11818,"C'mon, kids. Let's leave this awful place and never come back."
11819,Whuh?
11820,"Oh, baby!"
11821,No use struggling my beloved Chalamela.
11822,Animation is so great. It's way better than... whatever the alternative is.
11823,"Wait a minute, was that cat making out with that mouse? 'Cause if they were..."
11824,Pick me! Pick me!
11825,I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT / SHORT AND STOUT / HERE IS MY HANDLE / HERE IS MY SPOUT.
11826,That motion-capture suit is just what this country needs. Just think of all the hilarious motions that are going uncaptured. Like this...
11827,"See? Now wouldn't you love to see that move, performed by a cartoon possum?"
11828,You're right. That suit gizmo could be worth billions. And I'm gonna get a piece of the action!
11829,"I'd like to withdraw my life savings, please. And hurry!"
11830,"Oh. Yes, of course. Uh, she's behind that plant."
11831,"Hello, Marge. Hi, Homie. Sign this, please? You're the boss! Daddy, ask the man for some candy! No, no, no candy for you. Then at least get some candy for yourself."
11832,Kids.
11833,"So long, sucker!"
11834,"Uh Yes, I see that it's in bill form. Excellent."
11835,"I'd like to buy 500 shares of ""ANIMOTION, INCORPORATED."""
11836,Absolutely.
11837,You heard the monkey -- make the trade.
11838,Animotion.
11839,Yahoo!
11840,Huh? What is this crap?
11841,"Sleep tight, my beloved. You're my ticket out of this hellhole."
11842,Sorry. Our ticket out of this hellhole.
11843,Yes!
11844,"Oh, I hope ""plunging"" means ""up,"" and ""seventy-five"" means ""two hundred."""
11845,Family meeting! Family meeting!
11846,"Okay people, let's keep this short. We all want to get home to our families."
11847,"All right, first item: I lost our life savings in the stock market. Now, let's move on to the real issue: Lisa's hogging of the maple syrup."
11848,Point of order: I didn't lose all the money. There was enough left for this cowbell.
11849,"Damn you, e-Bay!"
11850,"I have a great way to solve our money woes: you rent your womb to a rich, childless couple. If you agree, signify by getting indignant."
11851,"C'mon, Marge. We're a team! It's uter-us, not uter-you."
11852,"You mean, like, medical testing?"
11853,"Yeah, but aren't those experiments dangerous?"
11854,Hmmmm.
11855,It burns! It burns!
11856,Food? I'm BLIND!
11857,Dammit!
11858,There's a crayon in my brain?!
11859,But I've had thousands of head x-rays. How come no one ever noticed it before?
11860,"Well, I'm not sure, but it mighta happened when I was six."
11861,"Hey, I came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted."
11862,"Hmmm. Increase my killing power, eh? Let's do it."
11863,I just underwent a procedure to increase my IQ fifty points.
11864,"And they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too."
11865,Is the capital of North Dakota Bismarck?
11866,"Dr. Joyce Brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect."
11867,"Now, who's up for a trip to the library tomorrow? Notice I no longer say ""liberry"" or ""tomorry""."
11868,It's a date!
11869,"Everything from Hop on Pop to Death Be Not Proud. It's so tragic, the way they hopped on pop."
11870,Get out!
11871,"Hey, Flanders, headin' for church? Well, I thought I could save you a little time."
11872,"Better. I was working on a flat tax proposal, and I accidentally proved there's no God."
11873,I am here to give hope to the least of you. Because we all have a crayon up our nose. Maybe it's not a crayon made of wax. Maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice...
11874,"Yes, Nelson?"
11875,"Not being a moron, I wouldn't know. However, ."
11876,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your moron!"
11877,You see? It's cool to be smart.
11878,"So be like me, and use your minds: paint a painting, sing a song, and dance a dance!"
11879,I've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.
11880,"I've decided to disintermediate the local authorities, and send it straight to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."
11881,"Comfy, isn't it?"
11882,"Wait, you can't hate me. I'm your better! Your better!"
11883,"Effigy, eh? Yeah, nothing burns like an effigy. Hey, that's me!"
11884,Stop that! The fire inspector would be appalled.
11885,So you all hate me?
11886,"Hmm, I'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern..."
11887,"Lisa, why didn't you warn me? Being a brain has alienated me from all my friends."
11888,"Well, what gets you through the day?"
11889,A walk? That's a really good idea.
11890,I don't understand. That wasn't funny.
11891,"Hey, don't blame me. This movie is tired and predictable. You know she's gonna wind up marrying Richard Gere."
11892,"It's Bill Pullman, you fool!"
11893,Is there no place for the man with a 105 IQ?
11894,I'm a Spaulding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Change me back to the blissful boob I was!
11895,That's ridiculous. You do nothing but play God! And I think your octoparrot would agree.
11896,"Oh, that would be heaven!"
11897,Moe Szyslak?!
11898,I want you to stick this crayon into my brain.
11899,"Deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher."
11900,Dee-fense! Dee-fense!
11901,Extended warranty? How can I lose?
11902,Who wants lottery tickets?
11903,We were what what in a what what?
11904,"Yeah, which reminds me, I need a sandwich."
11905,The wrestler?
11906,I'unno. Must be sumpin' I wrote before Moe fixed me.
11907,"Huh? Oh, you want a hug. Well that, I know how to do."
11908,Mmm... hug.
11909,Whuzzit... My juice box!
11910,Just give me ten more hours.
11911,"Did you say ""Smockron""?"
11912,Oh.
11913,"Man, that was a good Apron Expo."
11914,"Heh, heh. ""Grill Power."""
11915,"It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!?"
11916,Today!
11917,"Relax, they've got rodeo clowns."
11918,"That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red."
11919,"Hey, Toro! Here's something to gore!"
11920,"Not now, honey. Daddy's busy."
11921,"Now, for a little calming blue."
11922,"Hey, where's your blue shirt?"
11923,I can't complain.
11924,"Oh God, my back! It hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!"
11925,Uh-huh.
11926,And his fondness for the guitar.
11927,Air?
11928,There's an Air in Space Museum.
11929,"Oh God, my back..."
11930,"Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?"
11931,What are you looking at?
11932,"First I'd feel like having a BLT, then proud of you."
11933,My back!
11934,So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.
11935,"Yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front."
11936,"Hey, I thought real doctors hated chiropractors."
11937,"Less yakkin', more crackin'."
11938,"Hey, it feels a little better."
11939,"One, two, better-not-sue..."
11940,"Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didn't do anything."
11941,"Yeah, right. I did 'em while you were studying."
11942,Yeah... In fact...
11943,I feel fantastic!
11944,"Not ""trash can,"" son. Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending."
11945,"And as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains."
11946,"Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy?"
11947,"You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?"
11948,"Hmm. I don't know what that is, so I'm gonna say yes. Now, go limp."
11949,Next!
11950,"Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony..."
11951,Not unless you think about the irony.
11952,"Okay, that should do it, Moe."
11953,"Ah, you saw our bus ad."
11954,We might be able to do business.
11955,"Hey, where're you going with that?"
11956,"Wait a minute, no investor could bend like that."
11957,Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder!
11958,They'll pay for what they did to my can.
11959,Five? Why don't we make it fifty?
11960,You're gonna regret this.
11961,"Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals..."
11962,So many flavors! All those tasty memories flooding back!
11963,"Son, I know it hurts. I still remember my first lifetime banning..."
11964,"I can still see your movies, right?"
11965,...And I never saw Gallagher again.
11966,Tom Savini?
11967,Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out.
11968,You're right. Gimme a minute. Hmmm.
11969,For once in my life I'm tall. Don't take that away from me.
11970,"Hell-o, I'm Shaquille O'Neal. Let us in, please."
11971,"Sorry, son."
11972,No problem.
11973,Woo! Dinner!
11974,I love the theater.
11975,"Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the Rum District."
11976,"Aw, now, be nice, Moe. This guy just got out of the hospital."
11977,"C'mon, you're here to make friends."
11978,I can't decide. I throw myself on the mercy of the food court.
11979,And I'll have the beef Wellington.
11980,"Get that one! Faster! You got half time for the other ones. Oh, good. Oh no, that one's slowing up! Oh, good. Oh, that one's wobbling! Oh, up... you got that before I even said it."
11981,"Hey, let's get this down to the funeral home before they try to back out."
11982,"Oh, the whole deal. Coffin. Tombstone. Anti-stink spray."
11983,What funny names.
11984,That thing got picture-in-picture?
11985,"Ah, geez. How come they never call traveling anymore?"
11986,"Whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey."
11987,Okay!
11988,What?!
11989,Mr. Salesman?
11990,We're gonna go with the wolves.
11991,"Dad, I love you this much."
11992,"But that's just under nine hundred dollars. I wish I could go seventeen thousand, but..."
11993,"Tennis court, eh?..."
11994,I'll bet you didn't see that comin'.
11995,"Of course I do, Dad."
11996,"And if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all..."
11997,But try tellin' that to Killy McGee up there.
11998,What on Earth are you doing?
11999,That's tennis?! Then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
12000,Yes! That's what I wanted!
12001,"And finally, make sure the net is tight and springy."
12002,That seems about right.
12003,And it's bad news for the gophers.
12004,"Yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people over."
12005,"Keep walkin', Flanders."
12006,Fas-ter.
12007,"Sorry, I grunted way too early."
12008,"Hey, this was a lot of fun, guys."
12009,And how about that Stephanie the weather girl?
12010,Wow. How do you come up with such witty remarks?
12011,Get off my property.
12012,I've had it with that school!
12013,Door.
12014,"Hey, check it out! I'm surfing the net!"
12015,"Come on, Marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf..."
12016,I've got it! It's in the bag!
12017,"Do-I-have-cooties? No. Oh, this home testing kit saved me a fortune."
12018,"Ohhh, well that's bad news for Dingbat Charlie. He's gonna be crushed."
12019,"Okay, now some of that is me."
12020,"Okay, honey. I can see this means a lot to you. I'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored."
12021,Uh-oh.
12022,"Good news, honey. I found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. I've entered us in a doubles tournament."
12023,"Don't worry. The tournament's not till tomorrow. Okay, get ready for the serve."
12024,"How embarrassing. You take over, Bart."
12025,"Lisa! Lisa, beer me."
12026,"I'll be right out, honey."
12027,Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.
12028,"So Barney's like ""you're on your own, dude,"" and I'm like ""not even."""
12029,I'm getting to that.
12030,"Lookin' good, Honey. I think you and I might just win this tournament dealy."
12031,"Hey, Bart. Yeah, you got your daddy's hustle."
12032,"Too busy to reply, huh? I know how that goes. Well, I think I'll go lay out my clothes for the tournament."
12033,Per-fect.
12034,"Well, I'm ready for the big tournament."
12035,"Hey there, son!"
12036,"With that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament."
12037,It's gonna be tough without a partner.
12038,"Well, good for you! Anyone I know?"
12039,"Good morning, partner!"
12040,The name of Bart's partner? I'm all ears.
12041,"Yes, darling?"
12042,"No. No, no, no. You're my partner."
12043,Nooo!
12044,Traitors!
12045,Uh-oh.
12046,I don't think they saw me.
12047,"Hello, Marge."
12048,"Hello, Bart. How are the tennis partners?"
12049,Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.
12050,My manhood? I never thought of that!
12051,"I don't care about B.C., I care about M.E. My enjoyment."
12052,"It's obvious what's happening. I'm being replaced by a younger, more in-your-face version of me."
12053,Maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.
12054,Who pays for that wedding?
12055,"You're right. But just to be safe, maybe I should chain him up."
12056,I think you're underreacting.
12057,This session's under.
12058,Badbye.
12059,"No. No. Stay away from my wife, Bart."
12060,That's the guy! That's the guy from my dream!
12061,"Go ahead and smile, smart guy. I'm gonna mop you up like turkey gravy."
12062,"Absolutely, sweetie."
12063,"No, of course not. Now aim for your mother's heart."
12064,"Oh, come on. You've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. Now serve!"
12065,"Hey, leave my teammate alone!"
12066,Babies.
12067,Don't listen. It's a trick!
12068,I think he's trying to psych you out.
12069,"Well, look who's here. You two are goin' down."
12070,Did you hear that? She said we're goin' down!
12071,"Oh, that's loser talk!"
12072,"Unbeatable, eh?"
12073,"Comin' through... Hey, hi Otto... Sorry..."
12074,"Hey, that's great. Listen, I need a new doubles partner. My little girl's a lead weight."
12075,"Yeah, but only to crush my wife and son."
12076,"Hm, you seem less disgusted. Let's go!"
12077,Booo! You rot!
12078,Up- bup...
12079,"Now Lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. Let's just say I'm replacing you."
12080,"Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run across the..."
12081,Yeah.
12082,Everybody's been dumped but me. I'm undumpable.
12083,My tennis stick!
12084,Who are you?
12085,Which one am I? Serena or Venus?
12086,You're a girl.
12087,"You know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff."
12088,Courtesy of Pete Sampras.
12089,Sorry.
12090,Sucker.
12091,"Y'ello!... Hey, Moe. We're watching you on TV."
12092,"So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?"
12093,"Well, it all starts when the nulecule comes out of its nest..."
12094,A world without Krusty -- what would that be like?
12095,What's on TV?
12096,Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
12097,"Oh, yeah, uh, I was at the flower shop today, too. Yup, gettin' drunk at the ol' flower shop."
12098,Take it off!
12099,Go. Blow.
12100,"38! That's roughly my age! Marge, after a lot of thought, I've decided to run the Springfield marathon."
12101,"Stay out of this, Lisa. Marge, I've made up my mind. I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. Then we'll see who has it tougher."
12102,"Let's see. Sweatbands... check. Anti-chafing nipple tape... Check, check... and check."
12103,"I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind!"
12104,And thank you for assuming we're hip.
12105,"All right, now here's the 411: I'm a record producer, see. I'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for Bart."
12106,And my dream is to get rid of Bart.
12107,How many lives must you ruin?
12108,Will you two shut up? I'm missing precious VJ prattle.
12109,YVAN EHT NIOJ. Ya gotta love that crazy chorus.
12110,"Ah, it doesn't mean anything. It's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance""."
12111,"Wait a minute, Bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? That's pretty farfetched, Lisa."
12112,Here comes the jealousy bug. Gonna git ya! Gonna git ya!
12113,I wanna go home now.
12114,"So, ah, what songs did I miss?"
12115,"Yeah, that's the look."
12116,"Not ""MAD""! That's our nation's largest mental illness-themed humor magazine."
12117,'Bout time.
12118,Smelson! It's funny 'cause you smell.
12119,Am I ever!
12120,Kids... How would you... like to go to... Blockoland?!!
12121,But... the TV gave me the impression that...
12122,"Maggie, no!"
12123,We're here.
12124,I am a robot. Do what I say.
12125,I am a washing machine. Do what I say.
12126,Check it out. I built myself a healthy apple.
12127,"Yep, a shiny new apple."
12128,I get it. Everything's made of blocks. Even the water.
12129,What are you gonna do about it?
12130,Uh-oh.
12131,Leeches!
12132,"Welcome to real life, Lisa. You can't fight city hall, AKA Blockoland. So don't even try."
12133,It's what I always tell them. I told them that twice yesterday. And then again as they were going to sleep.
12134,"You're right, honey. Hear that, kids? The Simpsons are going to Blockoland!"
12135,'Scuse me.
12136,You sold my little girl a shoddy Eiffel Tower.
12137,"Yeah, you're right."
12138,"But before I go, I'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own."
12139,"Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine."
12140,"So, how's that new block I got you?"
12141,"You know, standing up for the little guy felt good. I'm gonna do it more often."
12142,Those bullies are gone now!
12143,"My heart was in the right place, jerk!"
12144,"Well, you're welcome, honey. Now, I'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?"
12145,"Don't worry, son. I'll handle this."
12146,Come on! Why won't you go out with Bart?
12147,"Please, ugly is such a smelly word. Who would you rather go out with?"
12148,"Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent."
12149,"And face it, you're no prize either. You wear braces, you dress like a kid and you're not gettin' any younger. Take what you can get."
12150,"They wouldn't? Well I'll go to bat for you, honey."
12151,"Nice place you got here. Ooh look, a hair net. Be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!"
12152,"Oh, how clumsy of me? And..."
12153,Oops!
12154,"Either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed."
12155,"Oh, really..."
12156,"Boy, you weren't kidding. Your profit margins are razor-thin."
12157,Wait a minute. Four hundred a month for loafer lightener?
12158,You get the same results with a mincing gel.
12159,The satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks I et cetera.
12160,"And I gave that man directions, even though I didn't know the way. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am this week."
12161,"Say no more. I'll help you, Lenny."
12162,I'm trying to get a refund for this ticket. Is this the executive office of the ball club?
12163,Oh.
12164,"Well, is that it?"
12165,Is...
12166,I see.
12167,I'm sorry to hear that.
12168,"Yes, sir."
12169,"Okay. So, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?"
12170,Albuquerque Isotopes? What is all this stuff?
12171,What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.
12172,"You're moving the team to Albuquerque, aren't you?"
12173,"Well, okay. But you can't silence Homer Simpson. I'm the friend of the downtrodden. And I'm not gonna forget what I saw here today."
12174,Wait a minute. Will this erase my memory?
12175,"Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?"
12176,I was? But I love the swing.
12177,"You know me. Occasionally, I'll be quirky. ""I'll be quirky..."" Albuquerque! I'll be right back!"
12178,Members of the media...
12179,...thank you for coming. The proof that the Isotopes are moving to Albuquerque is right behind this door.
12180,"Yes, that is an important story. But so is this!"
12181,"I don't mind being called a liar when I'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. But not when I'm telling the truth."
12182,That's it! I'll go on a hunger strike.
12183,"So? I can stop. And I will stop. I'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!"
12184,Let's see those double A baseball honchos ignore this.
12185,"My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains."
12186,Now it begins.
12187,"Man, he really hates Wayne Rogers."
12188,Don't worry. Duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
12189,Hey kid and man!
12190,Don't support a team run by liars!
12191,They're secretly planning to move to Albuquerque.
12192,Why you little...
12193,"Oh, so hungry... Can't give up... Must continue fighting evil corporation."
12194,"Nice try, God."
12195,But Homer Simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... Hey!
12196,Stop that!
12197,DANCIN' AWAY MY HUNGER PANGS / MOVIN' MY FEET SO MY STOMACH WON'T HURT / I'M KINDA LIKE JESUS / BUT NOT IN A SACRILEGIOUS WAY...
12198,I'm soooo hungry.
12199,What's going on? What am I doin' here?
12200,What?! That's not why I'm here!
12201,They're moving the team to Albuquerque!
12202,All this hunger for nothin'.
12203,Do they have to chew so loud?
12204,"Oh, I'm wasting away. I'm down to a B-cup."
12205,"Oh, I'm so hungry. Oh, why keep starving myself? No one cares."
12206,Who are you?
12207,Why do you look like Cesar Romero?
12208,Why are you here?
12209,But I wanna!
12210,What's happening? Did I crush your corporation?
12211,Me so hungee.
12212,"So hard to resist. Mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeño relish... Wait a minute, those are Southwestern ingredients!"
12213,Mango-lime salsa?! That's the kind of bold flavor they enjoy in... Albuquerque!
12214,"Tell the truth! C'mon, everybody!"
12215,"Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once in your life, stand up for the little guy!"
12216,The truth never tasted so good!
12217,What can you do? Sex sells.
12218,"They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance."
12219,Kids gone?
12220,You read my mind. Sooo...
12221,"This coffee's good, huh?"
12222,"You know, I think our marriage is..."
12223,I got it!
12224,"No, I do!"
12225,"Okay, now. Put..."
12226,You...you really scared us.
12227,That's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
12228,Noooo!
12229,This is such an eye-opener. I always pictured the kids dying in the living room.
12230,Three dollars? That doesn't seem so bad.
12231,Mm hm. Hmmmm.
12232,We don't need your high-priced safety junk!
12233,Thank you.
12234,"Now don't feel bad, honey. Did you know back in grade school, I had a bully problem myself?"
12235,EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING...
12236,THOSE CATS WERE FAST AS LIGHTNING...
12237,Good times.
12238,That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.
12239,But I'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare Maggie away.
12240,She will be.
12241,"See, honey, Daddy's protecting you from all the sharp scary things. Here, hold this a sec."
12242,"Ow! Oh, my..."
12243,"Okay Maggie, put it down."
12244,It...
12245,Down.
12246,"Oh. Okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore."
12247,Now do you realize how unsafe the American home is? Baby accidents occur every three minutes.
12248,"Yeah, but this is me talking. Look, I already encased the telephone in concrete."
12249,Reach into these holes. I use a carrot.
12250,Baby could order poison.
12251,"Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world."
12252,Get her outta here.
12253,"Savin' those babies. And the soft spots on their heads do, do, do, do do..."
12254,Problem: a pointy deity. And I've got the perfect solution.
12255,"Yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round Buddha."
12256,"So am I, but I don't get all huffy about it."
12257,Canceled.
12258,That's me! Safety dance!
12259,YOU CAN DANCE / YOU CAN DANCE / EVERYBODY LOOK AT YOUR PANTS.
12260,"Dear God, what have I done?"
12261,Babies of Springfield! We need your help! Please! Skin your knees! Put dice up your nose! Let cats sleep on your face!
12262,Woo hoo! Simpsons rule! Sorry.
12263,So all her bullying was just to get some attention.
12264,Just to get some attention.
12265,Pound that nerd.
12266,"""Olive oil?"" ""Asparagus?"" If your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people."
12267,"Well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home."
12268,In the cart.
12269,Cart.
12270,"My doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that..."
12271,Woo hoo!
12272,"Y'know, I always felt sorry for Marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun."
12273,"Wait, I changed my mind."
12274,Stack it in the order I'll eat it driving home.
12275,The customer's always right. That's what everybody likes about us. Now mush!
12276,Hurry up. I can't stand here jabbing you all day.
12277,No you don't...
12278,"No, I can handle it. I'll get you, squealer."
12279,"Oh, the bag boys are on strike! I'm shaking."
12280,If I can have this rubber stick.
12281,So hungry... There's gotta be some food left. Sulfur jerky... Cream of toast... Where did we get all this crap?
12282,Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is.
12283,Where? Over there?
12284,Hey!
12285,Yoink.
12286,My old lunch box!
12287,That Amos Burke made his own rules.
12288,Very old animal crackers!
12289,Mmmm... turbulent.
12290,Ow! What the hell?
12291,Africa? They're bound to have food there!
12292,"And on my free African safari, I want to do everything on this box."
12293,"I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight Muhammad Ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras."
12294,Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them.
12295,Ow! My eye!
12296,Woo hoo!
12297,"Hey, mister?"
12298,"On the plane, I'm gonna need two seats... for the twins."
12299,The Simpsons are going to Africa!
12300,Just like Jimmy Carter.
12301,That's okay. I got 'em.
12302,"Eh, bound to happen."
12303,Wowww... It just rolled over to ten thousand.
12304,"What did you just see, Lisa?"
12305,What did you just see?
12306,GLIBBIE GLOP GLOOPIE / NIBBIE NABBIE NOOBIE / LA LE LO LO LO.
12307,"Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. Whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born."
12308,"I've got more bones than that guy. If you're trying to impress me, you've failed."
12309,You have failed.
12310,"By the way, what kind of blood is this?"
12311,"Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!"
12312,"A hungry, hungry hippo!"
12313,Help! Kitenge!
12314,Good ol' Kitenge.
12315,Quick! Into the river! Hippos hate water.
12316,It's working!
12317,Leeches!
12318,"Okay, here's the situation: We're hopelessly lost and about to die."
12319,Don't worry. Being eaten by a crocodile is just like going to sleep... in a giant blender.
12320,I've got a map!
12321,"Monkey. Now, according to Animal Crackers, there's no river here."
12322,"So, you think they settled that bag boy strike yet?"
12323,Here's why they shouldn't get anything. One...
12324,This flower saved our lives.
12325,Not a chance.
12326,It's a flower.
12327,"I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel."
12328,Go.
12329,Or... more mouthwatering monkeys.
12330,Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous!
12331,"So, I notice your home smells of feces."
12332,And not just monkey feces either.
12333,You must be the most boring woman on earth.
12334,"I mean I knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez."
12335,Anything for these noble animals.
12336,So like us...
12337,Somebody light this monkey.
12338,Help! Bad monkey!
12339,"Look at me, I'm a scientist!"
12340,What a nice lady.
12341,"Hey, look! Our tour guide got a new job."
12342,I was wondering what became of him.
12343,"Now he's just a stinking flight attendant! Hey, where's my pillow?"
12344,Breakfast!
12345,Aww... Cereal? You know I like my breakfast fried or chicken-fried!
12346,"No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
12347,"Well, let's put him to the test. Me love beer."
12348,"Aw, he loves beer."
12349,"Here, little fella."
12350,I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot.
12351,"Ooo, can I have a brownie?"
12352,"Ooo, can I have dinner?"
12353,Homer wants a brownie! I'm gonna get one!
12354,Comin' in from the left.
12355,Or is it the right?
12356,Look out for the reach-around!
12357,"He shoots, he sco-- My thumb!"
12358,Oh God oh God oh God!
12359,"Sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, Marge!"
12360,"Reattach a thumb? This isn't ""Gattaca."""
12361,"Okay boy, drop the thumb..."
12362,Nobody's gonna tackle you.
12363,Come back with my thumb!
12364,"Come on! Come on, boy! Oh, please give it back. You want people food? I can get you people food."
12365,I have nothing he wants.
12366,Give me back my thumb!
12367,Gaa!
12368,"Okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me in bed with four beautiful women."
12369,"Marge, over here."
12370,But I have finger insurance!
12371,"Symmetry, eh?"
12372,We need more ice! My thumb is fading fast.
12373,"Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb!"
12374,"Thanks, Moe."
12375,"Well, I really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... Although I do like the occasional beer..."
12376,"Did you ever see that ""Blue Man Group?"" Total rip-off of the Smurfs. And the Smurfs? They suck."
12377,I've gotta get to Dr. Nick's!
12378,"Where's Marge?! That is so rude. I know, I'll hitchhike."
12379,"Oh, why isn't this working?"
12380,"Hey, thanks for stopping."
12381,"Oh, crap. It's on fire!"
12382,Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?
12383,Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
12384,It's too late.
12385,"Well, old friend, we always knew this day would come."
12386,Say goodbye to your brother.
12387,What in the hell was that?
12388,"Linguo, dead!"
12389,"No, Lisa, but I sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
12390,"Here, little fella."
12391,"I'm sorry. I thought he was a party robot, like in that play I wrote."
12392,My thumb!
12393,"Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb."
12394,"Did you ever see that ""Blue Man Group?"""
12395,Abra-ca-thumbra.
12396,Thanks a lot. Now I gotta walk to Shelbyville.
12397,What the hell...?
12398,"Linguo, dead!"
12399,"Oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!"
12400,"One Tower of Babel, and build it to Heaven."
12401,To Heaven!
12402,Christ be with you.
12403,Leave Ned alone.
12404,He can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. And there's only one way to find out.
12405,Does -- Rachel -- like -- Ned?
12406,"Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties."
12407,"Hey, she's coming this way!"
12408,"Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going."
12409,"Ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime."
12410,"He can hear you, Rachel."
12411,Hotel? Why don't you just stay at Ned's place?
12412,"Yeah, maybe it was too soon."
12413,"Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?"
12414,"Say bye, Mr. Flanders."
12415,"Yeah, a lifetime of memories."
12416,"Sure, of course I do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth."
12417,"Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up."
12418,Now for the awkward part. We gotta talk about money.
12419,What? That doesn't sound like me.
12420,Ahh... Is that a fact? And you think you know someone.
12421,"Hey, how 'bout that?"
12422,You're doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G.
12423,"Relax. It's a ""controlled burn""... Uh-oh."
12424,"Uh, yeah, teenagers."
12425,She's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? Can they do that?
12426,I am. I'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.
12427,No problem. I'll need a sack and something sharp.
12428,"Oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams."
12429,Do I detect a hint of cinnamon?
12430,"Don't say that, Ned!"
12431,"I'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other Godly hoo-hah."
12432,"Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it."
12433,Stupid grill!
12434,Why won't you light? The gas is on full blast!
12435,Good idea.
12436,Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't.
12437,"Ned, Praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. Look at those smiling faces."
12438,Rich laughing with poor...
12439,Bullies breaking bread with nerds...
12440,Orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... Lighting candles!
12441,Christ be with you.
12442,"Ooo, Ned, look who's here. It's that girl you don't like... not!"
12443,I think Ned is gonna be all right...
12444,You got that right
12445,"Pick me! Pick me! I've got hoop dreams, coach. I've got 'em bad."
12446,"Yes! Losers! Lo-sers! Lo-sers! L-- You said ""Homer,"" right?"
12447,Lo-sers!
12448,"Woo! You da man, Carl. I believe you can fly."
12449,"Okay guys, I've got a secret play I've been saving for the Olympics or possibly the Final Four, and it goes something like this... Uh, Skinner I want you... Moe, you can take ... Homer, you can take Groundskeeper Willie. No way am I taking Groundskeeper Willie. Yes you are. Are you a team player or not?"
12450,"Eat my dust, mortals!"
12451,I'm okay.
12452,Ow!
12453,Did you say anterior?
12454,Mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
12455,"I don't know, I'm still a little hazy."
12456,"Oh, yeah. Now I remember it like it was yesterday..."
12457,"Hey man, you're harshin' my buzz. Anyway it all started when..."
12458,Jet-son!
12459,Maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
12460,Miss work? But my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
12461,"But ""Dr. Screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. Well, you don't have to worry about the bill. We've never welshed on a... Look, a bear!"
12462,Run!
12463,"Two weeks?! Well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit on my ass and watch TV? That ain't my style, man!"
12464,No they don't.
12465,Everyone's having fun but me.
12466,"Well, I can still hang out with you guys."
12467,I'm so bored.
12468,"This place is so boring. I've gotta do something to keep from going crazy. I know, I'll breed the pets. To each other."
12469,"Soon I will have a miracle hybrid, with the loyalty of a cat and the cleanliness of a dog."
12470,"No, that's not how ya do it."
12471,Quitters!
12472,"Oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. Stupid Flanders."
12473,"Well, Marge isn't here. She had to identify a body at the morgue."
12474,"Well, they would keep me company. And this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal."
12475,"Sure, knock yourselves out, and call me Homer."
12476,"Daddy's not here, is he?"
12477,That is the darnedest thing!
12478,"Yeah, well. How was the concert?"
12479,"Hey, it was fun. My kids are sick of all my stories. But they just can't get enough of me!"
12480,Don't tell me what I'm not doing.
12481,"Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
12482,"Then I'll do it, just to see the look on your face."
12483,That's the one.
12484,"It's just a legal thing, to protect me."
12485,See for yourself.
12486,Sure. Go for the gusto.
12487,It knows you're afraid.
12488,"Aw, aren't they sweet. Any medical things I should know about?"
12489,"I owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it."
12490,Wonderful. Being with those kids gives me a high only morphine can top. Ya got any?
12491,Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!
12492,Peek-a-boo!
12493,Okay. IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IS THAT ALL THERE IS? / IF THAT'S ALL THERE IS / MY FRIEND / THEN LET'S KEEP DANCING...
12494,"Yes, but then I discovered the joys of raising children."
12495,"Don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own someday. Then you'll know my joy."
12496,If you're happy and you know it say a swear!
12497,Huh?
12498,"Aw, what a beautiful frame. Perfect for my day care permit. Sweet."
12499,Umm-hm.
12500,"Hang on, everybody. Three, two, one... Blast off!"
12501,"Aw, that's my girl."
12502,Is there a snack table?
12503,Don't film this.
12504,"'Cause the thing is, there are no bad kids..."
12505,Sorry. Daddy thought you were a pile of cable.
12506,My kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always loved.
12507,"Yes, through the magic of caring."
12508,I'll mace you good!
12509,"Please let me win this, Lord. 'Cause if you don't..."
12510,Yes!
12511,All my love has come back in trophy form.
12512,I'll call.
12513,I almost had a straight!
12514,"Hey, what's the deal?"
12515,"Well, I'd rather reserve judgement until I... oh my God!"
12516,That is completely taken out of context!
12517,Why you little...
12518,No! No! No one is taking my kids from me!
12519,"Run, children! Run!"
12520,Uh... For frosty chocolate milkshakes. Frosty chocolate milkshakes!
12521,I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
12522,Uh oh.
12523,"Why did you rat me out, kids? Was it because I showered love on those other children while ignoring you?"
12524,"Well, I learned my lesson. From now on you two are the only kids I'll care about. Oh, and Maggie."
12525,Now let's all enjoy the snack table while we still have it.
12526,"Yeah, that'll happen."
12527,Teamsters.
12528,The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
12529,"Hey, wait a minute. ""Airport tax, five dollars?"""
12530,"Well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. Waive it..."
12531,Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.
12532,The Simpsons are ridin' the rails!
12533,What are you gonna do to us?
12534,"Man, buffalo are easy to kill."
12535,"All right, but your next story better be worth it."
12536,"Oh, this'll be good."
12537,Whoopsie.
12538,A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.
12539,"I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O.J."
12540,What have I done? What have I done?!
12541,Aww...
12542,Big deal.
12543,I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.
12544,I'll meet you in Wilmington.
12545,"Raise your arm... Okay, the other one..."
12546,"Oh, it shows. I was gonna say something, but I thought it might sound you know, weird."
12547,It--
12548,Ew!
12549,"And it's important to feel good about yourself... Okay, spread your toes. Do you know how much glass is in here?"
12550,"Ah, Ethnictown. Where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy, overfed Americans."
12551,"Wait, this is just a shaved puppy."
12552,"The perfect crime. Marge, I have to be in court next Tuesday."
12553,"A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. See, this wart is a fake!"
12554,So much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
12555,Beads!
12556,Owww!
12557,"Hey, that's me. And that's you."
12558,What-ever.
12559,Are you coming on to me?
12560,Good as new.
12561,"Well, I... There. Right as rain, there."
12562,"Marge, that ""curse"" is just a lot of silly superstition. Right Lisa?"
12563,"Guys, I am not cursed!"
12564,"Oh, Moe, they're dead! And it's all my fault!"
12565,When did that happen?
12566,Let's make sure he's a leprechaun. Sing us a song of the Emerald Isle.
12567,"Ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves."
12568,"Good idea, Mr. Ed. Wanna come along, Noodle Neck?"
12569,"I know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, Irish-style!"
12570,Yah!
12571,"Wake up, ya lousy drunk!"
12572,Ew! Nasty!
12573,Yep. Everything worked out for the best.
12574,"Well, me saying I'm sorry won't bring him back."
12575,She's not the boss of me.
12576,"Mm, various eggs."
12577,Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!
12578,"Oh, I agree."
12579,"Yeah, that's the price of success."
12580,What's my blood alcohol?
12581,Keep 'em comin'.
12582,"Yeah, she's cool."
12583,"Lucky, shmucky. I knocked her up. But she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. But if I died, she'd be completely free. For man or machine."
12584,"Yep, a machine."
12585,"Mm, unexplained bacon."
12586,Good ol' table.
12587,Huh?
12588,"Yep. Man one, machine zero. How do you like that score?"
12589,"Die, you monster!"
12590,"Well, I am missing the back of my head. I think you could cut me some slack."
12591,"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this."
12592,"Yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special..."
12593,My sweet little angel!
12594,"Hey, we stayed for your kids!"
12595,"WON'T YOU MARRY ME, BI-ILL? / I GOT THE WEDDING GOWN BI-ILL / 'CAUSE WEDDINGS ARE NI-ICE..."
12596,"Didja hear that, Pengy? Forty dollars!"
12597,"End of the line, boys."
12598,I love our court days.
12599,Judge Snyder? While we're young?
12600,I'll bring the car around.
12601,What'd she say about cupcakes?
12602,"Uh, your Honor, I was chasing the KBBL Party Penguin Prize Patrol."
12603,And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion.
12604,Coooool.
12605,"Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", I think you'll agree that..."
12606,I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
12607,It won't?
12608,Tethered?!
12609,Room five?!
12610,It's a little tight.
12611,I used to be.
12612,"Oh, this punishment is so cruel."
12613,I'll medicate you...
12614,"...honey. You know, this could be fun. Race you to the kitchen, my little tether ball."
12615,Bo-ring.
12616,"Come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff."
12617,Fine.
12618,Cobras!
12619,"Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism."
12620,Swing!
12621,"Run, Bart! Pump your thighs! Pump them..."
12622,"I'm with you, son!"
12623,That's my boy...
12624,"C'mon, hug me..."
12625,Cobras! Cobras!
12626,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Owww! That really hurt.
12627,I thought I would hate working nights. But it's so peaceful. And there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.
12628,"Sure, boy."
12629,"Oh, son. You know that's none of your business. Say, is that our house?"
12630,"Oh, yeah... I forget things sometimes..."
12631,Really. You like skateboards? We're sure learning a lot about each other.
12632,"Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer."
12633,"I hit my head, Moe."
12634,Since when?
12635,"All right, all right. Come on, Bart."
12636,That's my little slugger.
12637,"Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundred dollars!"
12638,"Yeah, they're Italian."
12639,Moe? What the?...
12640,It's about time. Oh.
12641,"Well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey."
12642,"Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle."
12643,No!
12644,Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. Somebody tell me!
12645,"Ah, son, it's a little chilly. Maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head."
12646,What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
12647,Why not? Kids are very visual these days.
12648,But...
12649,"Hey, shut up."
12650,Ow! Why you--!
12651,Because I... Ow! You--!
12652,Ow!
12653,Ow!
12654,Ow!
12655,Why you little...
12656,We're free! Your mother set us free!
12657,Woo hoo!
12658,"Heyyy, how 'bout that? Ha, ha."
12659,"But, Constance, it only happened because..."
12660,"Wait. I'm to blame, Judge. You see, I was pressuring my wife to make love in front of our son... you're gonna laugh when you hear this... when suddenly..."
12661,I admit it.
12662,"Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately."
12663,Sorry.
12664,Dammit!
12665,"Well, that explains the sign."
12666,"You know, we could get out of these stupid things if you'd just tell the judge you're a bad mother. And you don't even have to say ""bad."" It could be ""negligent"" or ""unfit"" or ""drugged-up."""
12667,You're right. It's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.
12668,Easy... easy...
12669,"Shhh, you'll wake up Flanders..."
12670,"Hey, Marge, surf's up!"
12671,"Well, we tried all those other tools."
12672,Woo hoo!
12673,"Now, time for ""Operation: Judge-Get-Back-At."""
12674,"Okay, she lives at one Ocean View Drive. Let's start skulking."
12675,"It's only the milkman. Hey, maybe I should be a milkman."
12676,This address must be wrong.
12677,"She lives in a houseboat? Wow, she is so cool."
12678,"I know, I know. Fight the power."
12679,Cops!
12680,"Look at her in there, washing her body..."
12681,"I hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her."
12682,"Oh, it's just a friendly seal."
12683,Shut-uuuup...
12684,"Oh Lord, guide this cinder block..."
12685,Uh-oh.
12686,"Hey, how ya doin'?"
12687,So... it cost you nothin'.
12688,That was close.
12689,"Just the radio, dear."
12690,"The bridge column. Oh, that South. You never know what he'll do next. Hm... Aw. Look at that dad in ""Drabble."" He's like an unfunny version of me."
12691,Probably digging for drugs.
12692,No. Of course not.
12693,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up to. Kids shouldn't have secrets."
12694,"Oh hello, young man. Beautiful day for digging, isn't it?"
12695,"Yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?"
12696,"So, I guess you wouldn't mind if I was to dig a hole of my own."
12697,Maybe I will.
12698,Very little.
12699,I'm having chest pains!
12700,Where's the defibrillator?
12701,Clear!
12702,This thing pays for itself.
12703,"Yes. Eventually, I became King of the Morlocks."
12704,"You callin' me a liar, Carl?"
12705,"Oh, I just naturally assumed."
12706,Woo hoo!
12707,"Geez Moe, you've been a real crank lately."
12708,"Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. You're always pointing that shotgun at us."
12709,Maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
12710,That was an amazing throw.
12711,"Hey, where'd that painting come from?"
12712,"Ooh, ooh, pick me!"
12713,Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.
12714,No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy beer from you.
12715,I thought you said you had to go.
12716,"Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?"
12717,"Oh, I don't know. What would Moe say about that?"
12718,"But on the other hand, Moe's not here."
12719,For what? A little splattered food never hurt anybody. Now everybody shut up and dance!
12720,Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like Fonzie.
12721,Ayyy!
12722,Oh! Whoa! Hemorrhage-amundo!
12723,Ayyy.
12724,Yello?
12725,"Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?"
12726,I don't get it.
12727,What's the gag?
12728,"I'M A WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET, GONNA OPEN MOE'S BAR / I'M A SINGIN' WHAT I'M THINKIN' / HEY, LOOK AT THAT DOG."
12729,Huh?
12730,Teenage vandals smashing the bar! Moe's gonna kill me.
12731,You dirty teen.
12732,Moe? Wrecking Moe's bar?
12733,"Wow, well I I almost fainted, but then I didn't. What are you doing?"
12734,"And it would look pretty, too."
12735,"Hi, Formico."
12736,Sorry. He seems nice.
12737,"It's not fair. Just when I was getting to be the world's greatest bartender, it's all snatched away."
12738,"Freshen your drink, pal?"
12739,"There you go, doll."
12740,"Look, buddy, I don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here."
12741,"Wow, It looks like an alien headquarters. Couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? Couldn't ya? Hey, wait up."
12742,Not for friends of Moe's.
12743,Don't you know who I am?
12744,Cecil is a girl's name.
12745,Um... the rabbits are cute.
12746,"Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff."
12747,"Ah, whatever. Just give me a Duff."
12748,"Okay, look cool."
12749,That's it!
12750,I'm gonna tell Moe exactly what I think of his...
12751,"Moe, we want our bar back."
12752,"Oh, so you're ashamed of us. Well, you've turned into a big phony."
12753,"I'll throw myself out, thank you."
12754,I believe I had a hat.
12755,Suckers!
12756,I think it's pretty obvious. I'm turning our garage into a tavern. The kind Moe's used to be.
12757,It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.
12758,Beautiful.
12759,"But when I'm passionate about something, I see it through to the end."
12760,'CAUSE MOE'S A BIG JERK AND A SHE-MALE TOO!
12761,Barkeep!
12762,"It's the family bar. Right, kids?"
12763,As soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
12764,"She's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. Hee, hee."
12765,We're rockin' great!
12766,I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.
12767,Seems to me I already did.
12768,"Bar? I see no bar. This is a hunting club...Which is permitted by state law ""to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."""
12769,"Which I'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy."
12770,Lemons...
12771,It's the law. My hands are tied.
12772,"Okay, cranberry sauce, stuffing, potatoes. Come on, turkey. Join your friends."
12773,I would.
12774,"Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey..."
12775,Nobody's gonna kill you.
12776,"All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man."
12777,What the hell is that?
12778,A turkey!
12779,"A cougar! Die, cougar!"
12780,Got that cat right in the leg.
12781,"Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!"
12782,Son of a...
12783,"I'm sorry I shot you, Moe."
12784,"Hey, who invited the hippies?"
12785,"All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest."
12786,"And I'm thankful I get to spend Thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender."
12787,And here you go.
12788,"Ah. And now to read my fortune. ""Geese can be troublesome."" What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
12789,"Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that."
12790,"Oh, these fortunes are terrible."
12791,"These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness."
12792,Easy.
12793,You will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
12794,"Okay, let's see... ""The price of stamps will climb ever higher."""
12795,"Let's see. ""You will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""You will find true love on Flag Day."" ""Your store is being robbed, Apu."" Are you getting all this, Lisa?"
12796,Stop that dog! It has my gum!
12797,"Yes, Mr. Burns."
12798,Ummm...
12799,Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!
12800,"Oh. He ran his own casino, stole the Loch Ness Monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun."
12801,"C'mon, he's a total player."
12802,Windowsill.
12803,"Burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go."
12804,You're right.
12805,These would stop Joan Collins herself.
12806,"Yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man Burns."
12807,"Yes, Mr. Burns."
12808,"Oh, sorry."
12809,No problem.
12810,"But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted."
12811,Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.
12812,You're going to ask her to marry you?!
12813,Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
12814,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
12815,Let go of her or I'll scream!
12816,"Well, this is my house. Ah--"
12817,"Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape."
12818,Pistol whip?!
12819,Mmm... pistol whip.
12820,"Wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?"
12821,You know what would be surprising? A foot massage.
12822,"Um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?"
12823,Hmm...
12824,Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.
12825,Just a little more.
12826,"Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?"
12827,What about the wiener? A guy on TV lifted a can of paint with his.
12828,"Oh, I know."
12829,You mean a Van Dyke?
12830,"Marge, a bee almost stung me today. I felt the wind go right by my ear."
12831,"Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey..."
12832,"Hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! Well I can fantasize too."
12833,"Ooo, Mama Celeste."
12834,"Love? ""Signed photo""?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!"
12835,"Hello. This is Chad Sexington, the model for Burly Paper Towels."
12836,I don't know. But I was quite moved by your letter. I'd love to meet you and your family. Shall we say dinner?
12837,Perfect. I'll be there at seven.
12838,"I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?"
12839,"So, how was your day? Did anything unbelievable happen? Phone calls, things of that nature?"
12840,"Tonight? Well, you better get your hopes up."
12841,That's him.
12842,"Why look, it's Chad Sexington!"
12843,"It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. Oh, you're right. I've gotta make it up to her."
12844,"How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?"
12845,"No, huh?"
12846,"Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings."
12847,Zing! What's a Skeletor?
12848,Do me! Do me!
12849,I am in your power. Boss me around.
12850,"Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!"
12851,"Look at me, I'm Angie Dickinson! Out of my way!"
12852,I'm twelve years old... I'm with my friends. It's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... Oh my God!
12853,"Oh, that's better..."
12854,Here you go.
12855,Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...
12856,"Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys."
12857,"It was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. And to kill the boredom, we sang."
12858,"Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming..."
12859,Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
12860,Hey come on...
12861,"It's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses..."
12862,"Oh, hey, you guys can come with us."
12863,"Bye, Moe."
12864,"Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away."
12865,Never!
12866,This is it. This is the old quarry.
12867,Someone's yellow belly is showing.
12868,And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.
12869,And someone has eaten the flesh.
12870,"Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?"
12871,"Ooh, a movie! I call the couch!"
12872,"Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good, though."
12873,"Well Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry."
12874,Why? He'd just bury it.
12875,Seems kinda pointless now.
12876,Did you really make that envelope? 'Cause it says Hammermill over here.
12877,"WHEN YOU HAVE A RIB-EYE STEAK / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / OH, THAT MEATLOAF TASTED GREAT / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / NOW FLOSS IT, FLOSS IT GOOD."
12878,"Just a second, son. I've gotta put on my contacts."
12879,Science!?
12880,"Mmmm, pie pants."
12881,"This is Launch Master Homer, counting down. Five, four, three..."
12882,Two... one...
12883,"The word ""unblowupable"" is thrown around a lot these days, but I think I can say with confidence..."
12884,"Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen."
12885,What was that?
12886,"I have eyes, don't I?"
12887,I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
12888,"Dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good."
12889,"Super. Now if you'll gather around, I'd like to say a few words. All nerds clear the launch area."
12890,"Now all we need is our astronaut. Bart, where's America's newest hero?"
12891,"Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God."
12892,"Five, four, three, two, one... COUNTDOWN!"
12893,"Okay Nibbles, you can guide her down. Step one: Right in front of you is a blue handle. Pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds..."
12894,"Don't worry, I planned for this."
12895,You say that so much it's lost all meaning.
12896,'Cause he's all man.
12897,"Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!"
12898,I don't know how to feel.
12899,Got it.
12900,How was that?
12901,"So, you think you know better than this family, huh. Well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what I do and believe what I believe. So butter your bacon!"
12902,"Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy."
12903,Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.
12904,I think this tree could use an angel.
12905,It's go time.
12906,I don't know what Santa left you. I just know his name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.
12907,Bag's in the kitchen.
12908,I did it. I found our dog. Now our Christmas is complete.
12909,So you're back on the winning team?
12910,That's all I ever asked.
12911,A grizzly bear with a chainsaw. Now there's a killing machine!
12912,No problem. There's plenty of activities inside.
12913,The TV!
12914,Quit trying to control me.
12915,New shooter.
12916,"Oh, we'll see about that."
12917,"One, two, three."
12918,"I'm good for the rest, you know I am."
12919,They told me it would be like this on the outside.
12920,Why you little...
12921,Police brutality! And chew-tality!
12922,You got that right.
12923,Stanford.
12924,A heavenly choir. You must be an angel!
12925,"No, you are an angel like Denzel Washington in ""The Preacher's Wife,"" or Will Smith in ""Bagger Vance,"" or Slimer in ""Ghostbusters."""
12926,"Don't blame me, blame Tinseltown and its second golden age. May it never end."
12927,"Okay Gabriel, this is a ""bar."" It's where I go to drink ""alcohol,"" which is the mortal equivalent of your ambrosia."
12928,"Well, not with that temper."
12929,"Look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. Marge, Bart, girl-Bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. How I loathe him."
12930,"Okay, why are we in the woods? Is this heaven?"
12931,...Which is society's fault because...
12932,"Me. / Right here. / Oh, me too. / Please."
12933,Cooperate?! This is one family that doesn't swing that way.
12934,Gimme that beer!
12935,"Okay, family huddle."
12936,"Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we drive away. We cover for each other -- as a family. It's what Gabriel would have wanted."
12937,"Okay, but talk like this."
12938,What?
12939,"Look, Gabriel. We're learning to work together."
12940,"Oh, no! The roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!"
12941,"No! I will never... Oh wait, it's Blatz."
12942,"Hey, they're all right."
12943,WOLVES AND COUGARS ATE OUR ROAST BEEF!!
12944,I knew it!
12945,Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.
12946,"Oh, it's the woman I married in Vegas!"
12947,"Give it to me, baby."
12948,It's okay. We're married.
12949,"Marge, I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. Liquors drunkened me."
12950,"Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you."
12951,"Look, I married her, but that is as far as we went. We never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee."
12952,You can't kick me out. It'll cause a miscount in the census. A miscount!
12953,"Of all the things that have ever come back to bite me in the ass, this is the worst."
12954,"Please, just leave me alone."
12955,"Oh, yeah... Oh, that's good... Oh, don't stop. Oh, yeah..."
12956,"Faster... Faster... Faster... Oh, you do that like a pro..."
12957,Use both hands...
12958,Can't panic! Must remain calm.
12959,"Ah, the sweet couple of seconds before I remember why I'm sleeping on the lawn."
12960,"Marge, you're speaking to me."
12961,Talk about what? Sports? Bigamy?
12962,"Not a sports fan, huh?"
12963,"You know, there are only so many times I can say I'm sorry and still mean it!"
12964,I would if it wasn't for the kids.
12965,"Well, that's the last we'll see of them. Come on, we're goin' to Moe's."
12966,"My lady's glass is empty, Moe. Bring her another cookies 'n' creme martini."
12967,"You know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face."
12968,To Amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.
12969,Woo hoo!
12970,"A library selling books? If I don't want 'em for free, why would I want to pay for 'em?"
12971,I don't know.
12972,Okay.
12973,Oh my God! Wow. Now that's a goiter.
12974,"She said ""tavern"". I'm going to Moe's!"
12975,"Peace, my people. All shall be looked up. Let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. One hundred and sixteen."
12976,"No, the best book you've ever seen is Tom Clancy's ""Op Center."""
12977,"Ooh, here's a good one: The World's Most Overrated Saint."
12978,I've used up all these records.
12979,That's a great idea. Do you think I could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
12980,"The Simpsons are goin' to Mars, so pack your... Or maybe I'll think of something else."
12981,You're a cinch to be World's Fattest Man.
12982,I'm here to break a world record. What's the longest anyone's ever done this?
12983,"Fine, I'll just play the banjo with this cobra."
12984,"Wait, wait, wait..."
12985,But it's my banjo.
12986,"Yeah, they're called ""Congress""."
12987,Okay.
12988,Group stunt?
12989,Denver?
12990,Fellow Springfielders. I have called you all here so we can enter the Duff Book of World Records.
12991,We're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!
12992,Okay. Lemme check the specs.
12993,"Wow, my vision is coming to life!"
12994,Mm-hm.
12995,All right. I'll make a base camp here and try for the summit tomorrow.
12996,Why you little!
12997,Wait a minute.
12998,Ha! Ha! We did it! Springfield rules!
12999,Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!
13000,"Now that everyone's so open about being fat, I can finally stop sucking in my gut."
13001,"Yeah, you can't improve on nature."
13002,Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas?
13003,"Well, well. If it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage."
13004,It was dinner.
13005,I was hoping we could do that together.
13006,"Oh, I am so proud of you."
13007,Get in the car.
13008,"Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group effort."
13009,"Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine."
13010,Nothing left! Nothing left!
13011,"Ooh, ooh, a sticky spot!"
13012,Part of me knew that.
13013,I'm with you all the way. But first...
13014,Cool. Should I take off my shoes?
13015,Cool.
13016,Count Fudge-ula? I thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
13017,"Oh, you mean Tennessee?"
13018,I'm only doin' this one more time.
13019,Eww. I touched it. Over.
13020,Kinda.
13021,"Come on! Give it! I know, I'll try reverse psychology. I don't want that stupid map."
13022,That wasn't part of the deal!
13023,Has everyone keistered their personal supply?
13024,'Cause I sure haven't.
13025,No way! We'll defy you to the death!
13026,Remember what I told you about running away from your troubles?
13027,Let's do it.
13028,"Before I bring the sugar in, I want to see the Oompa-Loompa."
13029,"That guy is freaky. Well, here's your sugar."
13030,"Oh, they both make such good arguments."
13031,"No Marge, I love when you do that. You're a regular Carin' A-lot-ovich."
13032,That's what I told Lisa!
13033,"Ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine."
13034,"Ooh, they're showing the filling now. Can they do that?"
13035,What the hell is that?
13036,Rainbows... tank tops... empowerment... This is the Gay Pride Parade! Woo hoo!
13037,Look at those abs.
13038,Everyone here has a six pack and I'm the only one with a keg.
13039,"That's it, we're outta here."
13040,"Four tickets for ""Shenani-Goats!""."
13041,"Come on, show the movie!"
13042,I'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. Show the movie!
13043,So many previews. So many previews. So many previews.
13044,Start the movie!
13045,Stop the madness! Start the movie!
13046,I'm not scared of those ushers! What are they gonna do? Advance on me?
13047,"So long, suckers!"
13048,My mouth. My beautiful mouth.
13049,Broken jaw?
13050,Uh-oh.
13051,Mm hmm.
13052,I'm horny!
13053,Nicely done.
13054,"And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen."
13055,I learned so much about my family. You'd be surprised how much you hear if you just listen once in a while.
13056,I was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
13057,"Sure thing, Alky."
13058,Krackle was my favorite.
13059,"Well, as much as humanly possible."
13060,Ostrich burgers! Get your ostrich burgers!
13061,"Okay, you pick one out and I'll punch it to death."
13062,"Dude, I thought we were friends."
13063,I'm not proud of that clip.
13064,"Well, I don't know. The demolition derby is next month..."
13065,"Well, okay. For you I'll be as dull as Dilbert."
13066,I'm gonna kill you!
13067,"Yes, and I was merely reading the title: ""I'm gonna kill you."""
13068,Yep. Nothin' to get excited about.
13069,"Professor Van Doren, so good to see you."
13070,I just poured myself a new glass of milk. The old one sat out for a little while. Are you comin' to bed?
13071,"Marge, I could stand here and argue with you, but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk. Goodnight, honey."
13072,Marge? Marge is gone! But at least the Demolition Derby form is...
13073,What?! Nooo!
13074,Listen to all that revving!
13075,"Drivers, start your engines!"
13076,But bold moves are no longer my forte!
13077,"Oh, what do I do? What do I do?"
13078,"Ah, this beer's deliskous. I'm gonna saves me wife! Now let's get this show on the road."
13079,Quit banging my wife!
13080,Looks like I need some fuel for me mule. Gas for me ass.
13081,"Aw, looks like a little angel. Now to save me Marge."
13082,"That's okay, Marge, you're a good wet blanket. The kind I like wrapped around me."
13083,"Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge!"
13084,Unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
13085,What's goin' on?
13086,"Hey Marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya."
13087,"Spill it, moneybags."
13088,"It's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs."
13089,"Hm, a million dollars? Wait a minute. How much sex would be involved? 'Cause if it's ""some""..."
13090,"Hey Marge, I just thought of something."
13091,"If we had Artie's money, I could get that snoring surgery. Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately need."
13092,One squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
13093,"Yeah, I..."
13094,"Honey, did you get any sleep?"
13095,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
13096,Uh huh.
13097,"Okay Ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no funny stuff."
13098,"And by funny stuff I mean handholding, goo goo eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any John Woo film--"
13099,"This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday comin'."
13100,Yeah. Homer sold his wife for a million bucks.
13101,I didn't sell her. I just rented her to an old boyfriend.
13102,"Gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... Swings in the old battin' cage."
13103,"Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for this guy? Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?"
13104,"Oh God, you're right. I've gotta get her back before it's too late."
13105,That's enough running.
13106,"Oh my God, it's our high school prom! And once again I have no date!"
13107,"Hello, Dondelinger."
13108,Just for twenty-five years.
13109,"Oh no. If Marge marries Artie, I'll never be born!"
13110,"Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing a far superior man."
13111,"My life here is over. Lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?"
13112,Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.
13113,"I saw something terrible, and I can't even say it so I'll have these two dolls do it for me."
13114,"I'm leaving you, Marge. The next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. Don't worry about the kids -- I'll drop 'em off with Patty and Selma."
13115,Patty and Selma? Screw that!
13116,"Just run the camera, you little..."
13117,"Goodbye, my darling."
13118,"Oh, it's no good. Everything reminds me of Marge."
13119,What did Carl think?
13120,Do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? Something indoorsy.
13121,"This job'll be perfect. I'm gonna leave this world the way I entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman I love."
13122,Another oil well successfully capped.
13123,Oh no! This is how Faceless Joe lost his legs!
13124,Marge?!
13125,Why? So I can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? I don't think so. Good day.
13126,"We said ""Good day""!"
13127,Woo hoo!
13128,"Artie, thanks for saving my life. Now, I believe there's a little matter of the million dollars..."
13129,"Oh, I can't take his money... I can't print my own money... I have to work for money... Why don't I just lie down and die?"
13130,"I gotta hand it to Artie Ziff, Marge. That little nerd saved my life."
13131,"Goodnight, honey."
13132,No. The Olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!
13133,You wait 'til next month! You wait 'til next month!
13134,I'm bored. Heyyy... a fair!
13135,But knowing about it would make you want to go here.
13136,"Ten-four, princess. Is that your beer tent?"
13137,Ow!
13138,Monkeys cry.
13139,Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee!
13140,Sorry.
13141,"Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flanders bids fifty dollars."
13142,"Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, I promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is."
13143,In South Carolina.
13144,You will too!
13145,Go gamecocks!
13146,"Look, boy. Here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy..."
13147,What the hell is that?
13148,"Wow, what kind of mileage does it get?"
13149,"Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, she's looking at us. Be cool."
13150,"Hello, gentlemen. Would you care to meet my new best friend..."
13151,Rainier Wolfcastle.
13152,"These courtside seats are great. Thanks for the hookup, Wolfie."
13153,"That I do, sir."
13154,DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!
13155,Ouch! I sat on something sharp!
13156,I have a Boyle on my ass.
13157,Cockfight.
13158,Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?
13159,"All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!"
13160,Doesn't matter. They have free health care.
13161,I'm rich!
13162,Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?
13163,"There she is, boy."
13164,"Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So you go over there and you win her back."
13165,"Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you. I'm gonna take a nap."
13166,"Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie."
13167,"Oh, right."
13168,"Really? Ooh, this I gotta see."
13169,"Oh, he just wants to make friends."
13170,"Ooh, who's a good dog? What a goody doggie! Oh what dee de bobo! Echee chee googie!"
13171,He's a good doggie!
13172,Ooh it-it ooh googie googie!
13173,"Look Bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you for no reason."
13174,Just you wait!
13175,"Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
13176,"No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks."
13177,"It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food..."
13178,Swell.
13179,Because I want to be your hero. On top of which I don't look bald.
13180,One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it.
13181,CAN'T KEEP IT IN...
13182,I've seen fancier.
13183,"Oh, listen to you. ""Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. "" How old are you?"
13184,I've seen drunker.
13185,For shame!
13186,"Bart, I couldn't help noticing Buck is a total fraud. So I took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall."
13187,"Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?"
13188,Yes!
13189,My son lost his hero. This should be the greatest night of my life. How come I'm not happy?
13190,Stop saying that.
13191,Nice old man. Don't break a hip.
13192,"Mmmm, something smells delicious."
13193,I'm still not givin' up on Buck. There must be some hare-brained half-assed way...
13194,Get me Buck McCoy.
13195,Here you go. Just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. I'll wait in the car.
13196,That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
13197,You don't need that.
13198,Dad!
13199,Whoa. There's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey!
13200,Aren't you forgettin' someone?
13201,And don't you forget it.
13202,"Not now, Marge. I'm waitin' for the new XFL season. Who will win this year's Million Dollar Game? Who? Who?"
13203,"The ""X"" is for extreme!"
13204,Who told you?!
13205,And he never even lived to be a vegetable.
13206,"Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him."
13207,"Sure, I said I loved him. But never that I was ""in love"" with him."
13208,"Aw, Dad... We've got what people never get, a second chance."
13209,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll call you. Or send you some fruit."
13210,You sunk my Scrabbleship!
13211,Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.
13212,Semper fi.
13213,You? No way. It's too dangerous.
13214,That was a D.W.I.
13215,"Well, you brought me into this world, so no."
13216,"Dad, get up."
13217,No way.
13218,"Oh, no. I'm not giving you my car. You'll probably drive it."
13219,"Wow, a booth. If I'm tired, I can just lie down!"
13220,No you can't.
13221,"You're slow to react, Dad."
13222,In real life he would die.
13223,"Hey, watch the movie."
13224,"Give me those keys. Do you have any idea what you put us through? I called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... Okay, this isn't about who I called."
13225,Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
13226,"Straight up, Marge. That hoochie only likes you because you can drive."
13227,Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do.
13228,"No, he's gotta learn, Marge. The way my dad made me learn."
13229,Cosmic.
13230,And another thing: no death races!
13231,Huh?
13232,"Oh, that is it! Abraham J. Simpson, you are never driving again!"
13233,Ever!
13234,"Oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father."
13235,We've gotta go after them.
13236,"Uh, we'll wait for the next one."
13237,"Here we are: Branson, Missouri!"
13238,Only in public.
13239,"Overdue book?! This is the biggest frame-up since O.J. Wait a minute... blood in the Bronco... the cuts on his hand... those Jay Leno monologues... Oh my God, he did it!"
13240,"Oh yeah, I checked that out when Bart was born. I was gonna read to him every day."
13241,Stuff kept comin' up -- mostly car-related. Piece of crap...
13242,I decide who reads and when. How 'bout now?
13243,"Hm, ""Homer's Odyssey."" Is this about that mini-van I rented once?"
13244,"That mini-van had the biggest cup holders. And change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!"
13245,Fine.
13246,It was the end of the Trojan War. Clever Odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the Trojans once and for all...
13247,Stupid King of Troy. I think I speak for all the Greeks when I say this war has gone on for too long.
13248,"Anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. We hope you don't have a horse."
13249,Trojans.
13250,"If I'm laughing at what I think I am, it's very funny. Anyway... ""As night fell, the Greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."""
13251,"Now, I can return to Ithaca, and my sweet wife Penelope."
13252,Forget it. Sacrificing animals is barbaric. Now have the slaves kill the wounded.
13253,"Gentlemen, I must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me."
13254,"Boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!"
13255,Almost home!
13256,"Thanks for your help with the anchor, guys. Guys?"
13257,That pig looks like Lenny.
13258,Mmm! That's the next best thing to eating Lenny.
13259,I'm still hungry.
13260,Those were my friends?!
13261,"That's it, I'm going home. Which way to Ithaca?"
13262,This truly is Hell!
13263,"Honey, I'm home!"
13264,"Oh, I'm sorry I was gone so long. But I'm gonna do something I haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash."
13265,"Sweet Penelope, you're just as beautiful as you were when I left."
13266,Quit suffocating me. I'm going to Moe's.
13267,"Oh, here's the story of Joan of Arc..."
13268,"This one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called ""France..."""
13269,"...The French were fighting the English, in The Hundred Years War, which was then called ""Operation Speedy Resolution."""
13270,"Son, how's it going with the breakfast pâté?"
13271,Victory? We're French! We don't even have a word for it.
13272,Burn this guy! He lost our good bucket!
13273,Wow.
13274,"Our next story is ""Hamlet,"" by William Shakespeare."
13275,"I don't know, but that would be hot. ""Once upon a time there was a young prince of Denmark."""
13276,It's cold outside. You'll need a sweater. A sweater!
13277,"Son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. Called ""Ghostbusters."""
13278,Now that's what I call a moon shot.
13279,I'm pretty sure it wasn't.
13280,"Boy, did you make a prank call to Brazil?"
13281,Choke on your lies!
13282,Which phone company? There are hundreds of them. And they all keep changing their names.
13283,We are not paying this bill.
13284,"Fine, I'll cut off your ponytail."
13285,"Marge, it's called negotiating."
13286,"Ooo, fascinating."
13287,"I told you, I have too much time on my hands."
13288,Why didn't you call me?
13289,That's it. They have awoken a sleeping giant.
13290,Get me tools and beer.
13291,"Free service, here we come."
13292,"All right, let's try the red one."
13293,"Okay, I'll try the green."
13294,Let's try the red one again.
13295,Not again! Ow! Let's try 'em together.
13296,Maybe the red one...
13297,How did I get here?
13298,The one I didn't make and Marge didn't make and Bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.
13299,"Yeah, the one we both like."
13300,Don't you know the boys from Brazil are little Hitlers? I saw it in a movie. Whose name I can't remember.
13301,No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.
13302,I said forget it!
13303,"Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him."
13304,How many people live in Brazil?
13305,Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.
13306,"The Simpsons are going to Antarctica. Next year. This year, Brazil."
13307,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So in August... it's cold?"
13308,And in February... it's hot?
13309,"So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies..."
13310,So hot snow falls up?
13311,Woo hoo!
13312,"Forget every word, boy. It's useless."
13313,Wow. It's like He's on the dashboard of the entire country.
13314,"Way ahead of you, Marge."
13315,TAKE ME TO THE HOTEL / MY HANDS ARE ON A GUY'S ASS / BOY THIS DUDE MUST WORK OUT...
13316,"Look Marge, I'm Brazilian."
13317,"I got it, I got, I got it."
13318,"Hey, and a mini-bar hat."
13319,...I WILL EAT THIS TOBLERONE / AND I WILL NOT PAY!
13320,"There he is! It-- Oh wait, you said brown hair, right?"
13321,"Ooh, they look like Skittles."
13322,"Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him?"
13323,"Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?"
13324,"But you're on vacation, honey. I'm not wearing my wedding ring!"
13325,"We'll do our best, honey. Now let's get goin'."
13326,Check please.
13327,Does that include tip?
13328,How did you know?!
13329,"Mine keeps disappearing. Oh, well."
13330,I hope they're goin' somewhere good.
13331,"Okay boy, let's strut our stuff. I GO TO RIO"") I'M IN RIO / AND I'M WALKING ON THE BEACH / I'M IN MY SPEEDO..."
13332,Gimme a drink with all your sweetest Brazilian fruits mixed together.
13333,Sweet. Sweet! SWEET!
13334,Ahhh...
13335,"Hey, Bart. How many more places do we have to search?"
13336,Taxi!
13337,So that means I don't have to pay the fare.
13338,Woo hoo!
13339,"Fine. Take me, but let the boy go."
13340,"Eh, same old garbage!"
13341,This corn doesn't look so big.
13342,What?!
13343,I'll regroup at Red Lobster!
13344,You ain't pretty no more!
13345,"Aw, look. I've made some friends. And now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!"
13346,"So Lisa says by killing their enemy, I became the alpha-crow."
13347,"I'm sure he'll turn up. Look, here's one of his buttons."
13348,"There's Russell Crow, Cameron Crow, Crow Diddly, Hume Crow-nyn, Gregory Peck..."
13349,"It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder."
13350,"Drop it in, don't cram it in. Oh, forget it, I'll do it myself."
13351,"Awww, look, Maggie wants to fly too."
13352,"Hey, cut it out! Put her down!"
13353,"Oh, thank God you're okay."
13354,"Okay, that was not cool. We need to lay down some ground rules--"
13355,"We'll get to that. Right now, I think we need some time apart--"
13356,"All right, that's it. Shoo, you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!"
13357,That is not a worm.
13358,Ow! Ow!
13359,I hate getting stitches in my eyes. Stupid crows.
13360,"Hm, fascinating. Say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?"
13361,Does it go in the butt?
13362,"Look, man. I don't do drugs."
13363,I had a bad experience with drugs...
13364,"For me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight."
13365,"But isn't marijuana, or ""dope,"" illegal?"
13366,"Okay, let's see: ""Toke as needed. Caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."""
13367,SMOKE ON THE WATER / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO DOO / DOO DOO
13368,"THEY BURNED DOWN THE GAMBLING HOUSE - IT DIED WITH AN AWFUL SOUND / I AM HUNGRY FOR A CAN-DY BAR / I THINK I'LL EAT A ""MOUNDS""..."
13369,"Marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal."
13370,I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
13371,"Marge, I just realized: I am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". And if you tell anyone..."
13372,"Hey, it's me. I got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out."
13373,I didn't. But now Daddy's special medicine...
13374,"Which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets Daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. Ever."
13375,Sh-sh-sh.
13376,"Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders! You got the mustache and the didilly... Okay, now do Wiggum."
13377,"Oh-ho-ho-ho right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you."
13378,"""Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot, that He Himself could not eat it?"""
13379,Now you know what I've been goin' through.
13380,"Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?"
13381,Wow. Wow. God does so much for me. And he doesn't ask anything in return.
13382,"Done and done. Now, do Wiggum."
13383,I said Wiggum!
13384,"Oops! I thought this was the can, man."
13385,You just said it!
13386,You're covered with a very fine fuzz.
13387,Hardly working...
13388,"Whoa, whoa, one question at a time. Yes, you?"
13389,"Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to ""Yes-I-cannabis."""
13390,We have a kitchen?!
13391,Look at Shemp! He is so high!
13392,"And ""Otto"" is ""Otto"" backwards."
13393,"As soon as I graduate, I am so outta here."
13394,"We gotta get out and stop that initiative. Marge, I'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos."
13395,"Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs..."
13396,'Cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!
13397,"Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented ""The Matrix,"" medical marijuana can make things fabulous. Medically."
13398,"So my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on Tuesday the seventh..."
13399,"Oh man, they already voted. And we lost!"
13400,"Oh, man, I can't believe we spaced on the date."
13401,"Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands."
13402,"Although, wow!"
13403,"Oh, I could have smoked that pot. And worn that hair."
13404,Eyes? What the hell are you talkin' about?
13405,All right. I'll do it for my kids.
13406,Never!
13407,Get out.
13408,"Oh, yeah. Get out."
13409,Going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.
13410,"It's been three days. And my mind is clearer, my sperm count is up, and I'm able to recognize simple shapes and patterns."
13411,"Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this."
13412,"As a reminder, Marge."
13413,Y'ello.
13414,But I can't find you funny anymore.
13415,This stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.
13416,"Start inhalin', Waylon."
13417,You mean that guy on 60 Minutes who yells all the time?
13418,"Oh, man. Oh, man. We killed Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad."
13419,So what? Mr. Burns is dead.
13420,"Bill Clinton, everyone! He's Jimmy Carter with a Fox attitude."
13421,And now a man you will see is definitely not dead... Mr. Montgomery Burns!
13422,"Mr. Burns, as we're running long, may we skip your speech and go directly to the questions?"
13423,"Mr. Burns, may I field that one?"
13424,It's true we're losing money...
13425,"But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away."
13426,Mr. Burns has left the building!
13427,And you wanted to take him to the hospital.
13428,Want a chocolate?
13429,Waiting for my wife. She has a surprise for me.
13430,"Did you say ""life story""?"
13431,"Things started out great. I ate what my mother ate. And my mother loved chili. Then, suddenly:"
13432,Don't you have criminals to catch?
13433,My father and I were never really close.
13434,I never found true happiness until I met Marge.
13435,And life just gets more exciting.
13436,Then came the day that changes every couple forever. The day we got our elephant.
13437,"While I wait for my family, I'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss."
13438,"Ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together..."
13439,"All my other senses are getting sharper. Bart, you had pizza for lunch. Lisa, you're extremely depressed."
13440,Kathleen Turner!
13441,Are the proceeds going to charity?
13442,Woo hoo!
13443,That was at my expense. What kind of a roast is this?
13444,I'm sick of your lies. Secrets and lies. It's always secrets and lies.
13445,Secrets and lies...
13446,You name it.
13447,Stupid lawn chair!
13448,Come on... unfold you...
13449,Ow!
13450,"This'll teach that stupid chair. I'm on fire! Oh, I hope no one's drawing this. Ow!"
13451,"Always drawing your old man, huh? You must think I'm the greatest dad in the world."
13452,Lousy minor setback! This world sucks!
13453,I hate them so much!
13454,"Oh, I've been there, man."
13455,My ice cream sandwich! Then where the hell's the remote?!
13456,Why do people keep moving it... stupid...
13457,That guy's hilarious. I especially like his white shirt and blue pants. Wait a second... Angry Dad is me!
13458,What kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?
13459,Why that little...
13460,"Stupid ""Bart-toon""! Bart-toon, that's clever. I'm gonna kill him!"
13461,"Stop it! The more you rock, the angrier I get!"
13462,Leave me alone!
13463,"Uh, uh... we're just rehearsing for ""Angry Dad: The Motion Picture""."
13464,That's just so obvious!
13465,It should be Gary Oldman!
13466,I'm just passionate -- like all us Greeks.
13467,"Oh, I am..."
13468,"Oh my gosh, you're right. I'm a rage-aholic. I just can't live without rage-ahol!"
13469,Is it also the last step?
13470,Very well. I'm not gonna be Angry Dad for one day longer. I'm giving up anger forever!
13471,I said anger.
13472,"I gave up anger forever. From now on, I'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers."
13473,"Ah, nothing can make me mad out here."
13474,Must suppress rage.
13475,"Hello there, Flan-didly-danders."
13476,THEY CALL ME MELLOW YELLOW... QUITE RIGHTLY! THIS FELLOW NEVER BELLOWS... QUITE RIGHTLY!
13477,This looks suspicious... but delicious!
13478,Cacti!
13479,Dirty diapers on strings!
13480,Time to put this ordeal behind me.
13481,Homer mad!
13482,Homer mad! Homer smash! Get revenge on world!
13483,"Well son, I wanna show you how grateful I am. Let's go fishing."
13484,Who knew that anger was savin' my life?
13485,"You're trying to get me angry, thank you."
13486,"I love you, boy."
13487,Stop it now.
13488,"I need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till I tap the keg."
13489,Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to come? In a Civil War reenactment we need lots of Indians to shoot.
13490,Hi-Yo!
13491,"Oh my God! I know you must get this all the time, but can I suggest a flavor?"
13492,Grape.
13493,She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.
13494,"Okay, okay, don't go Mary Todd on us."
13495,"C'mon Barney, if you're gonna be General Grant, you have to have a drink."
13496,One drink won't hurt.
13497,Mm-hmm!
13498,This was supposed to be a mock battle! Mock!
13499,Don't worry. I'm just gonna drain the area around your wound. So cold... so cold...
13500,"Now, you just take the kids home. I've got to return this keg."
13501,Why do you always take the side of local merchants?
13502,"Now Apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. And here's proof."
13503,Apu?
13504,That giggle is none of my business. Or is it?
13505,What's a eunuch?
13506,"""Unique, unite..."""
13507,"Nothing, nothing. There's nothing eating me up inside."
13508,Let's go.
13509,"I know, can you believe it? Oh, Manjula's just gonna die!"
13510,"In my role as customer, I saw the whole thing."
13511,"Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock."
13512,"Here, guys."
13513,Why don't you play this?
13514,"Marge, why are you crying? You're not in any physical pain. The only kind of pain a man can understand."
13515,He already knows. Let's tell Krusty.
13516,That guy's hilarious. His reaction would be priceless.
13517,Apu is cheating!
13518,I think he's building to something.
13519,"...So anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--"
13520,"Okay, this isn't easy, so I'm just gonna come out and say it."
13521,"Let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash..."
13522,I saw you and that Squishee Lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!
13523,Yes. You are scum.
13524,"Mmm, caramel baloney."
13525,You might hear from your friends or co-workers that Apu isn't living at home anymore.
13526,You bet I am!
13527,U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
13528,And Krusty. We gotta invite Krusty.
13529,Yeah! 'Cause if they don't...
13530,This is going great.
13531,"Uh, we didn't order that."
13532,Can I lick your fingers? Meet me at the mail slot.
13533,It's where I got this!
13534,"Hey, Apu, I think she likes you."
13535,Whee! Whee!
13536,It's been on my list for a long time.
13537,I bought the issue for Richard Avedon's pictures of Lenny.
13538,Woo!
13539,It was magic. He took a Cockney flower girl and turned her into my fair lady.
13540,"Wait, wait. You forgot to eat a light bulb."
13541,Here you go. Don't worry. I soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.
13542,"Well, hookers and Spiderman."
13543,"Are you okay, Lisa?"
13544,"Aww, she must have dreamt about Hitler again."
13545,...I GET KNOCKED DOWN / I GET KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN / YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOCK ME DOWN!
13546,"Hey, where's my keg?"
13547,I TAKE A WHISKEY DRINK / I TAKE A CHOCOLATE DRINK / AND WHEN I HAVE TO PEE / I USE THE KITCHEN SINK / I SING THE SONG THAT REMINDS ME I'M A URINATING GUY!
13548,FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX! FLEX!
13549,"That's it, boy! It's time for your bath!"
13550,Now go to bed!
13551,That is called parenting. I'm going to Moe's.
13552,"Good night, Bart."
13553,"Good night, Lisa."
13554,"Good night, Maggie."
13555,"Cherish these moments, Homer."
13556,What the-- You earned how many credits without our permission?
13557,Against my wishes!
13558,"Oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. But if a woman did it--"
13559,"Oh, come on--"
13560,You're right.
13561,"I was trying to throw Bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree."
13562,"Marge, where's my pellet gun?"
13563,Right.
13564,"Oh no, not the good cheek!"
13565,Oh.
13566,"Guys, I just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond."
13567,"Certainly, Lenford. Make every day a celebration of your love. Surprise her with a pasta salad! Put a mini-beret on your wang!"
13568,"Hey, hey, hey, no peeking."
13569,"Happy anniversary, Marge!"
13570,What the hell is that noise?
13571,"Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is a visit from kindly old Dr. Foot."
13572,"Fine, I won't kill it."
13573,Finish the job.
13574,Are you sure God doesn't want it to be dead?
13575,"If he wants to sleep with us, forget it."
13576,Once upon a time there were three bears. The end.
13577,"Oh fine, I'll go back to the beginning."
13578,"Oh no, I crushed that horrible bug. What should I do?"
13579,"Bury it. Quickly, before anyone finds out."
13580,I'm gonna tell!
13581,Now we're in it together. There's no goin' back.
13582,Yeah!
13583,"Uh, he's sleeping."
13584,"Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh..."
13585,Woo hoo! He's alive. Now you can't punish me.
13586,Lousy Community Service. Meals on wheels! Eat it up or I go to jail!
13587,"Uh, they discontinued the cobbler."
13588,Now let's not get into who smells like what.
13589,Safe and sound.
13590,That's better.
13591,"Thank God. I'm out of matches. Oh no, here's another one."
13592,Please don't kill me! I won't tell anyone about the skeleton. And I could bring you more victims. Like Lenny! He'd go great with wild rice.
13593,But what about the axe?
13594,"Eh, you're the shut-in."
13595,"...so I threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp."
13596,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking."
13597,My pleasure.
13598,And I can ride my bike real fast.
13599,"Hey, I'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- Oh-ho-ho, you mean me? I'd be delighted."
13600,"Y'ello! Hi, Mrs. Bellamy. No, I'm not doing anything. I can mow your lawn."
13601,Cover for me.
13602,"Hello?... Uh-huh. Yes Mrs. Bellamy, I'll be right there."
13603,"Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. They put spells on you!"
13604,Laxative?
13605,The Missus prefers you call me Simpson.
13606,Are you all right?
13607,Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--
13608,O-kay.
13609,Buh... guh... muh... wuh. Zuh.
13610,Without a trace.
13611,"Oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. From our point of view. Financially."
13612,"Now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... DOES THAT EVER WORK?"
13613,"Book 'im, Lou."
13614,You'd be dead a million times.
13615,"Oh man, what a day. I'd kill for a beer."
13616,I'd stab somebody for a pickle.
13617,Gimme some peanuts.
13618,I'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
13619,What? It goes right by our house.
13620,Here's my underwear drawer.
13621,Mrs. Bellamy's necklace!
13622,"You know Chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you."
13623,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. I know who stopped up the toilet!"
13624,Can't you do anything? Surprise witnesses? Evidence tampering? Play the race card. Play it.
13625,Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!
13626,"Y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side..."
13627,Just think of them as twinkling stars.
13628,I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. Marge is completely innocent. The only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder I did.
13629,Now you do it for me.
13630,"Goodbye, Marge."
13631,What?!
13632,I knew it!
13633,"This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never been so relieved! Relieved and angry."
13634,"Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for TV ratings."
13635,I've made my choice.
13636,"So hot, so sticky..."
13637,Marge?!
13638,You know what will cool this place down? A little touch of winter.
13639,"Lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!"
13640,Jingle bell what?
13641,A blackout?! Every time Santa and I get together it's a disaster.
13642,"Oh, no! They're stealing the tire fire!"
13643,No.
13644,No.
13645,No! I've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that Santa Claus. No more irresponsible behavior.
13646,"All right, but not the imported."
13647,"You've got to set limits, Marge."
13648,Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhouse's birthday party.
13649,"Oh. Seriously, everyone says your parties rock."
13650,"I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this."
13651,Wrong answer.
13652,"Marge, doesn't Lisa have a human face?"
13653,That's it. Nobody messes with my little girl. I'm gonna find those dolls.
13654,"See, when you don't use Milhouse, it's hard. I love this kid."
13655,"Interesting. All right, I've come up with a composite sketch of my prime suspect."
13656,Exactly.
13657,"Look at him over there, eating that apple. What's he planning? What?!"
13658,You're right. What's this?
13659,A cap!
13660,"From ""The Woolly Bully."""
13661,Do you sell hats?
13662,To people?
13663,People with heads?
13664,Did you steal dolls from my daughter?
13665,"Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie."
13666,"Good, 'cause I need directions."
13667,Aw...
13668,"Hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. And I felt like a big man pushing that kid around."
13669,Cheese!
13670,"Oh, well... Heh, heh. Hm... oh, I'll... no...."
13671,"You know, I've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation Krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, Mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the Mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, Smithers, Poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, Kwik-E-Mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. But protecting Springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all."
13672,"Finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people."
13673,"Fellas, I'm starting my own private police force. Will you join me?"
13674,How 'bout Lenny?
13675,You'll do as I say or I'll have your badges. Once I make and give you your badges.
13676,"Flanders, I was able to find your missing leaf blower, belt sander and morning newspapers."
13677,Who said it was a he?
13678,Who said you did?
13679,"You're pushing your luck, pal."
13680,"Ooh, ooh! Here's my commercial!"
13681,"Is this you? If it is, don't dial nine one one. Simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two."
13682,"Have no fear, SpringShield's present!"
13683,The only friend you need is SpringShield.
13684,"You know, the old lady's apartment was actually Lenny's. We just used a different duvet cover."
13685,Green vegetables and homework.
13686,Even dessert?
13687,Woo hoo! I'm Chief of Police.
13688,"Now that I am the law, I'm gonna make a lot of changes around here. First, I'm gonna cut overhead by freeing Otis, the lovable town drunk."
13689,What a character.
13690,"Well, according to this, he's tellin' the truth."
13691,"All right, Fat Tony. Your little game is over."
13692,"If that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, I love this song."
13693,"I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL NIGHT, HAND'S WET ON THE WHEEL... THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT DRIVES MY HEEL... IT'S MY BABY CALLIN' ON THE TELEPHONE... I GOT SOME PIZZA AND I'M BRINGIN' IT HOME..."
13694,"You all know me. I've kept the streets safe for you and your children. I've tricked or treated at many of your houses. Last year I was Jar Jar Binks. Now, who will stand and fight with me?"
13695,"Shut up, Flanders. Anyone else? What about you, Dr. Hibbert?"
13696,After everything I did you're going to abandon me?
13697,"What, and let them come after you and the kids?"
13698,In one car? With no air conditioning? And the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?
13699,I need you guys to help me. Why'd you lock yourselves in?
13700,"I don't get it. I finally did a job where I wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt -- and now I'm gonna get killed for it."
13701,"Yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. And if you kill him, someone'll take his place. And that's pretty much the end of it. The town'll be yours."
13702,"Yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. I'm giving this badge to the next guy I see."
13703,I must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.
13704,"Aw, she's taking a nap."
13705,"She's just like Clark Kent. When there's lots of excitement, she's nowhere to be found. Nighty-night, sweetie."
13706,Now to spend some quality time away from my family.
13707,"Oh, I'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now I have to sleep them off."
13708,Were they now?
13709,The hammock man! I'm glad he's a little early today.
13710,You had me at comfort.
13711,"Mr. Hammock, say hello to Madam Ass."
13712,What the...? It made another me! How cool is that?
13713,"Hm, no belly-button."
13714,Shuttle's in the hangar!
13715,You wanna be my slave?
13716,Outstanding.
13717,"Speed it up, ugly."
13718,"Eh, he had a good run."
13719,I'm gonna need help with this.
13720,Hm...
13721,Beer... for me?
13722,"No, you've got chores to do."
13723,Chores? Me need clone.
13724,Clone?! That's ridiculous. Where am I supposed to find a... wait a minute.
13725,"Wow, four of me. I think this could be a magic hammock. And it just might be the answer to my problems."
13726,Outfit good... flatters butt.
13727,Me good Dad.
13728,"I'll take it from here, Fake-o."
13729,Nuh-uh.
13730,Uh-huh!
13731,Why you little...
13732,"Man, are we evenly matched."
13733,Me concur.
13734,"I mean, four!"
13735,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
13736,"Yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card."
13737,Ned...
13738,"Twenty-three. Now, today I'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with Bart and girl it up with Lisa."
13739,"Ohh, I gotta get rid of these guys."
13740,"Now before I abandon you in this cornfield, does anyone remember the way home?"
13741,I do!
13742,Anybody else?
13743,Anybody else? Come on...
13744,"Okay, everyone out!"
13745,Now to make sure this hammock never troubles anyone again.
13746,Beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer-beer!
13747,Len-ny.
13748,"You'd think so, but no."
13749,"Yeah, it's a good group."
13750,Noooo!
13751,We're out of donuts!
13752,"Mmmmmm, donuts."
13753,Good news.
13754,First over cliff.
13755,You like back rub?
13756,Not Mr. Blasty?
13757,"It's okay, boy. You'll be shooting angels in heaven."
13758,"Marge, let me do a solo. This could be my big break."
13759,"Hey, so are the Grammy judges. --"
13760,Gimme!
13761,"Hear me, people of the past!"
13762,I come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. Grab your guns and follow me!
13763,"Oh, how to explain this to a child... Hm... Future Daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- Get 'im!"
13764,"Hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?"
13765,"Hey, I've been around Scotsmen."
13766,"Hey, I'm on vacation."
13767,"You mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?"
13768,Bring back some ice.
13769,"What's up, honey? Want a little lovin'?"
13770,Isn't vacation sex always the best?
13771,"Marge, you were like a wild beast. So voracious and prowly."
13772,And I've never seen you use your tail like that.
13773,"Oh my God! She's become a monster! Which I have to admit, I sort of suspected during the sex."
13774,Gotta find a way to change Marge back. And replace the M&Ms I took from the mini bar.
13775,Flanders?! A perfect vacation ruined.
13776,"Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned."
13777,Fine.
13778,"You know, you're not helping."
13779,"IN THE JUNGLE, THE CREEPY JUNGLE / HOMER RIDES A FREAK..."
13780,What's that?
13781,I can't believe it. Hibbert's turned you all into human guinea pigs!
13782,Eat... my... shorts?! Why you little...
13783,Maggie!
13784,Lisa!
13785,What game?
13786,"Manimals, invertebroads! You must fight back against the one who did this to you!"
13787,Wait'll Moe sees how wasted I got without him. He's gonna plotz.
13788,You guys are nuts. All you can do is eat and sleep and mate and roll around in your own filth and mate and eat... where do I sign up?
13789,"Hi, Moe, got any beer?"
13790,What the-- Where's my money?
13791,So you're just gonna let me walk out of here sober.
13792,And you can live with that.
13793,Fine. There are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.
13794,"Oh, yeah."
13795,Lick 'em. Go away.
13796,"Jewish? Oh, no, I'm not Jewish."
13797,"Well, Moe..."
13798,Oh.
13799,"Ah, I don't care about the color of your skin, Lenny. You're my friend!"
13800,"Oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya..."
13801,I've had just about enough of you.
13802,I'm outta here...
13803,"Hey, you want my keys?"
13804,"Get 'em now, jerks."
13805,"So long, jerks."
13806,"Running after the car, huh? Let's see if you can follow this."
13807,Moe's Tavern.
13808,"Good morning, everybody! What's for breakfast, cutie?"
13809,"What? Wait a... That can't be right! Wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?"
13810,"If I was that drunk, I would remember it."
13811,Couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
13812,"Of course. It was, uh... some kind of a... light rail."
13813,"Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?"
13814,And that's why you're my favorite.
13815,"All right, time for my favorite show."
13816,I don't remember anybody telling me I was gonna be on TV.
13817,"Yeah, I'm pretty great..."
13818,That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?
13819,"Oh, I can't believe they took ""Monkey Trauma Center"" off for this."
13820,Lousy family...
13821,A hot babe...
13822,"Oh, I don't resent you, sweetheart. What I was trying to say, and maybe I didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go..."
13823,"Oh, what have I done?"
13824,"Hey, what's this suitcase for? Are we going on a trip?"
13825,Where are you taking me?
13826,You can't just leave me out here! There's not another woman for miles!
13827,"""The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!!"" But I thought you guys were mad at me. For once in my life, I'm confused."
13828,Damn straight.
13829,You what?
13830,"You guys are the best. I love you, I love you, I love you..."
13831,"I'm okay. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you..."
13832,"Hey, what gives? Where are all the rock stars?"
13833,What was that?
13834,Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! It's Mick Jagger and Keith Richards...
13835,Woo! STD's!
13836,To rock!
13837,Are you ready...to receive professional training in rock?!
13838,I am so excited I couldn't fall asleep! I even took some pills I found on the floor and still nothing!
13839,"Uh-huh. Now I'm afraid that if I stop talking, I'll die. Isn't Mick cool? I thought he'd be all like, ""I'm a rock star. Aren't I great?"" But he's just like you or me or Jesus over there."
13840,"Out of my way, Nerdlinger."
13841,Here you go.
13842,"Ooh, I'm telling Mr. Jagger."
13843,"Like this, Mr. Kravitz?"
13844,Mr. Seltzer?
13845,"No, I think it's Seltzer."
13846,I came up with a stage move I feel is very cool.
13847,"Baby, baby, baby, baby!"
13848,Sorry Mick!
13849,"I'M SO HOT FOR ME, I'M SO HOT FOR ME / I'M SO COLD..."
13850,Bor-ing.
13851,But rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
13852,Precisely.
13853,I got 'em!
13854,I'm entitled to a private life! I'm not a role model! And so forth.
13855,We know!
13856,"Well, whaddaya think?"
13857,Really? You really think I'm better than you?
13858,What the hell are you doing here?
13859,It's been a week already?
13860,"Wait, don't go! I wanna keep on rockin'. C'mon guys... a-one, a-two..."
13861,Noooo!!
13862,"No! No, I won't go! You can't make me!"
13863,I knew nothing!
13864,Never!
13865,"My dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. I was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. I'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing."
13866,I'm so despondent.
13867,But I like it...
13868,For serious?
13869,Can I have forty guest passes?
13870,Woo hoo!
13871,"Wow, All-Access. All-Access..."
13872,Good thing it's laminated.
13873,All-access.
13874,All-Access.
13875,"And after the show, you can come backstage for pizza and pop."
13876,Here you go. Front and center.
13877,"Oops, gotta run. Enjoy the show."
13878,"Evening, fellow rockers."
13879,I'm ready. Just give me a guitar. How many solos should I do? Four?
13880,I'll do four.
13881,My official tour jacket!
13882,"Look at-- Wait, they misspelled ""Guitar Hero."""
13883,Can't you do it?
13884,"Oh. Okay. So I'll, uh... okay."
13885,"Test, test..."
13886,"Test, test. Check, check."
13887,"Test... ""TEST TEST, YOU'RE TESTIN' MY LOVE FOR YOU, CHECK CHECK, YOU'RE CHECKIN' TO SEE IF I'M TRUE..."""
13888,TEST ONE-TEST TWO-TEST THREE-TEST FOUR YOU TEST ME LIKE THE WATER IN EL SALVADOR...
13889,"BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY... Uh-oh."
13890,"Oh, yeah... When you've been in as many as I have, you can sense them coming."
13891,"What am I, the lost and found?"
13892,"There's no need for apologies, guys. You're rock stars! You're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail."
13893,"Well, you're very sweet, Mick, but the only rocking I want to do is in my living room chair, surrounded by the world's greatest back-up group, my family."
13894,"Nah, I've got something to remember 'em by."
13895,"Have fun at school, kids."
13896,Rock and Roll! Woo hoo!
13897,I hate reality shows...
13898,"I've grown, you haven't."
13899,"I can't take any more of these shows. If I wanted reality, I'd finally have this lump looked at."
13900,"Stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. Nice going, geniuses."
13901,"Marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children."
13902,"Come on, kids. Daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk."
13903,Woo hoo!
13904,No problem.
13905,"Hey, Flanders -- check out my new satellite dish!"
13906,I bet you would.
13907,Damn your sparkling wordplay!
13908,"Oh, it's red wire to red wire. What idiot dreamed that up?"
13909,Mmm... feed...
13910,"Kids, kids, you're both right."
13911,Put pie here.
13912,Me not pig.
13913,Homicidal robots... so like us.
13914,They're gonna be in the same class as each other?
13915,An old army buddy is visiting Mannix?
13916,The status quo.
13917,"Hey, you can't fool us. We're from the ""Learn to Fart"" state."
13918,"Well, what about Bart?"
13919,This is where the kids were last seen.
13920,"Well, he's not gonna get very far without that."
13921,"Bart, is that you?"
13922,"And Maggie, you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing Bart and Lisa."
13923,Dew-ey! Dew-ey! Dew-ey!
13924,Woo hoo! I win the bet! Who's your Daddy?
13925,Not if I can stop that inauguration!
13926,Let's hear it.
13927,"You know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself."
13928,Domiciles for the Destitute? Is this that thing that Jimmy Carter does?
13929,"Well, if Bart can be ""El Barto""..."
13930,"Oh, thanks..."
13931,"Huh? Oh, right. Can you hold it?"
13932,My real ring's inside a turtle.
13933,Can I help you?
13934,... And that's how my beautiful wife brought our son Bart into the world.
13935,"Sure, why not?"
13936,"Hey, why would I want Purina when I've got Fancy Feast right here?"
13937,"Aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. Well..."
13938,Did you label the meals so I can tell which is which?
13939,"Well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. Goodnight!"
13940,"Hey, gimme some of those blankets."
13941,"What's this? It's enormous! Oh my God, there's another one!"
13942,Explain later!
13943,I fell off. Hee hee hee.
13944,"Yeah, he truly is a monster. Hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. Just you, me, the kids and the twins. Whadaya say?"
13945,"Well, that cinches it. Lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response."
13946,"That's not true, Lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song."
13947,"YOU TOOK A TWENTY-KARAT DIAMOND, AND MADE IT GLEAM / LIKE A BIG SPAGHETTI DINNER, SMOTHERED IN WHIPPED CREAM."
13948,AND THEY'RE ALL MINE...
13949,Uh... I was gettin' around to it.
13950,Forget it Kiki. You're not putting your brain into her body.
13951,No dice. Take your fun and adventure outside.
13952,Wait for what? Confirmation of my attitude?
13953,"Shut up, boy."
13954,"With the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup."
13955,"Gentlemen, say hello to Springfield's newest supermodel!"
13956,I'm on it.
13957,Do you have anything with ground-up whale in it?
13958,"I came out the elephant's mouth, right? 'Cause I already showered once today."
13959,"Kids, I'd like to reintroduce you to classic Marge."
13960,"Not at all, sweetie. At least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one."
13961,"Oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling."
13962,Let's go get fried chicken!
13963,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
13964,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
13965,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...
13966,Woo hoo! I got skybox tickets! And with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. Life is...
13967,"Check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. If you can call that hockey."
13968,Why can't they just be happy for my success?
13969,"Fine, watch your stupid Eagles concert."
13970,Whatever.
13971,Because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.
13972,Hm. Better add some more nails.
13973,Perfect.
13974,"Hey, get out, I'm in here! Oh."
13975,I go by how funny the sign is.
13976,Don't worry. We'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. The time will just fly by.
13977,"Eh, that was boring. Let's get a hotel."
13978,Stupid Bran Producer's Convention.
13979,"I know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, Lenny."
13980,"That's Lenny? Oh, I wanted the black one."
13981,So how do you afford such a sweet pad?
13982,Who wants to eat a loser?
13983,"1895, forget it. We'd be too late to save Lincoln and too early to save Kennedy."
13984,"It's not a time machine, Moe."
13985,"Marge, I'm still not sure about this."
13986,I'll teach you to whistle on the Sabbath!
13987,Where's that kid with my latte?!
13988,"He's not coming, is he? Is he?"
13989,"Oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, Lisa."
13990,"Wow, they had an army helmet under every bed!"
13991,"Befoul an army helmet? You'd like that, wouldn't ya, hippie?"
13992,"Finally, I'm no longer a slave to the Gillette Corporation."
13993,"Why, it says here that President Cleveland has..."
13994,"Okay, more coal, less coal, less, less, more, less-less-less! Annnd... none."
13995,Perfect.
13996,"You know, it's six fifteen, the kids are in bed and Maggie's in her cage..."
13997,Maybe I could wuther your heights?
13998,"All right, let's take that..."
13999,This comes off.
14000,"All right, let's see what we've got here."
14001,"You've been in there over an hour, boy! Other people have to confess too, you know. Oh, I can't hold it in. I hate this house!"
14002,"Look, we can't give up. We're on TV. And when you're on TV, you dig in your claws and you never let go. Just like Bill Moyers!"
14003,"Oh, I wish you would reconsider the proposal of Hiram Beatwife."
14004,"Marge, I'm off to the blacksmith to get my tooth pulled."
14005,Lisa! Explain!
14006,Marge! Throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!
14007,"You monsters! You've turned this show into a ""Survivor"" clone."
14008,"I would never sign that! Unless there was a red sticker that said ""sign here."""
14009,Where do you get those things anyway?
14010,Our lives are ruined!
14011,I can't remember the last time I cried like this.
14012,"Oh, yes! The tag chafed my throat! Let's go eat some bugs."
14013,"Savages! I'll handle this, Marge."
14014,We come in peace. We takem your land.
14015,"Wow. Marge, I think I figured out their primitive language!"
14016,And now to wreck their precious helicopter.
14017,"Yeah, but... okay... Oh..."
14018,That Lenny sure had a crazy apartment.
14019,No more reality shows for us. Let's watch some quality scripted television.
14020,That's it! TV was the one good thing in my life and now I can't enjoy it any more.
14021,If we formed a club we could serve drinks.
14022,"Good idea, Lisa."
14023,"Hm, the water's off. I'll use my eye to see what the trouble is."
14024,"Hm, off again. Maybe I can hear what's going on."
14025,"So, this has become a game of wits, has it?"
14026,Perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
14027,Mail call!
14028,"The ""George Foreman Mail Sorter"" will let us know."
14029,Your family is invited to a free weekend at Stagnant Springs Spa.
14030,Don't struggle. You'll only sink faster.
14031,Oh my God! A naked celebrity. Be cool. Don't stare at his famous wang.
14032,Do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.
14033,"Wait a minute, I'm not wearing a shirt!"
14034,"Mmm, steamed Gentile."
14035,"Triple, no. Definitely no."
14036,"So, which one of these psychos is gonna help me catch my killer?"
14037,"Well then, you might as well stay with us. We serve the same meat the prisons do!"
14038,You'll understand someday when you have kids.
14039,"Wow, you don't even have to point it at him."
14040,"Hmm... Well, there's Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, The Emperor of Japan, ex-President Bush."
14041,"PBS, Stephen Hawking, the fat little Dixie Chick..."
14042,I'm a people person. Who drinks.
14043,Gotcha.
14044,I just wanted to impress you.
14045,"Mardi Gras, eh? Didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?"
14046,"Uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, I'd like to buy a copy of Jugs and Ammo."
14047,"Look, Junior. I expect this to be fixed with quality GM parts."
14048,"Just fix it, Mr. Sasswrench."
14049,"Right, right. I'm countin' the pennies in the ashtray. There's two!"
14050,You're so smart. Shock him.
14051,"Ooh, someone's coming!"
14052,Moe! He's got a dark side I've never dreamed of.
14053,Once I kill you everyone will think I'm the real Homer!
14054,"Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think."
14055,Oh my God! He's getting closer!
14056,Very well. I am gone!
14057,Don't look at me!
14058,Right here.
14059,Woo hoo! Good things do happen to bad people!
14060,"Marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen."
14061,"Nonetheless, the people have spoken."
14062,"Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday."
14063,But I'm not drunk!
14064,"Now Bob, I know you're concerned, but don't worry. I have operatives working the crowd."
14065,"America loves its Kings, from George the third to Larry."
14066,"Phew, just Italians."
14067,Oh my God! Attention drunken idiots: this is your king! Sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
14068,They're not for dudes!
14069,I did it!
14070,You saved my life!
14071,Don't be so sure. I've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.
14072,We're up so high. Where could that shot have come from?
14073,"Well, duh."
14074,Your king needs these stilts!
14075,Not anymore!
14076,"Hey, I know you. You're my mechanic, Junior."
14077,Frank Grimes...
14078,Frank Grimes...
14079,Oh yeah. How is old Grimey?
14080,"Whoa, wait. Frank Grimes wasn't married. How could he have a son?"
14081,"We know. Frank Grimes, Jr."
14082,"Yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. Goodnight, son."
14083,Bart! Turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
14084,"Goodnight, sleepyhead. Do you have to poop?"
14085,You know what made me feel better about myself? That award I got for World's Greatest Dad.
14086,Which I did.
14087,Mm... trophy.
14088,Disney World?
14089,Gator Gulch?
14090,"Wait a minute... I know where we're going... Oh, it's horrible..."
14091,It's even boring to fly over it!
14092,"Oh, God!"
14093,Let's go make some fireworks of our own.
14094,I wouldn't have it any other way.
14095,"Hey Skinner! Do you and Edna want to join Marge and me at ""Great Moments With Mr. Eisner""?"
14096,"Oh, you mean the Enron ride. Let's go."
14097,Who will take home The Rampy?
14098,Purple Rain!
14099,Michael Jackson just told me to shut up!
14100,What a rip! You all should be ashamed!
14101,"Well, here's ours. We're going to Disney World!"
14102,"Oh, it's so beautiful."
14103,"One churro, please."
14104,Here!
14105,"Lisa, nobody likes a shill."
14106,I love that little shill. Let's get her that diary.
14107,Oh-my-God-oh-my-God-oh-my-God.
14108,Watch and learn.
14109,More free samples.
14110,"Eh, it's still better than Indian food."
14111,"One Turbo Diary, please."
14112,Now what am I gonna get Lisa?
14113,"Lisa's not gonna want that. Oh, what can I get her?"
14114,What are you buying? Jerk stuff?
14115,"Hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. Maybe Lisa will like this better than the diary. Stupid Flanders, you're a genius!"
14116,I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
14117,"Well, yes and no."
14118,Mostly no.
14119,But it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- Lisa Simpson.
14120,...Lisa Simpson.
14121,...McNuggets.
14122,Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present.
14123,Maggie.
14124,...Lisa Simpson.
14125,"...McNuggets. Mmm, McNuggets."
14126,...magazines.
14127,"Maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her!"
14128,"Oh, what have I done? Children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?"
14129,"Good morning, honey. Did you cry out all your angries?"
14130,"Oh, Lisa's still mad at me."
14131,I did it for the insurance money.
14132,"Look Lisa, I'm still trying to get to know you. Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury? Is it Jeff Lynne?"
14133,But I'm full of questions. What's your favorite cigar size? Is it Robusto? Is it?!
14134,"Oh, my daughter hates me because I don't know anything about her."
14135,"Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go?"
14136,Drunk cop? Is that you?
14137,"Ooh, pie."
14138,My name is Homer Simpson. And I desperately need your help.
14139,How did you know?
14140,Priceless.
14141,"I need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think I'm a good Dad."
14142,"Anything to trick my daughter into liking me. Now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at AOL."
14143,It's one word.
14144,Chunkylover53.
14145,Dot com.
14146,"Ah, the information I've been waiting for."
14147,You should know. It is your favorite album.
14148,"Wait, wait!"
14149,I thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.
14150,On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!
14151,"So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious."
14152,"Well, we should get along. I mean after all, I am your... ...father."
14153,Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself?
14154,"Uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."""
14155,"That's right, honey."
14156,"You did it! Lisa thinks I'm the greatest. I might even put you to work on Bart and Maggie, go superdad on all their asses."
14157,"Oh yes. Well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! How did you spend a thousand dollars?"
14158,A forty dollar steak?!
14159,You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets?
14160,I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
14161,You'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
14162,Of course I do. It's all my fault for refusing to pay...
14163,"... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. Yes."
14164,I look just like Elvis!
14165,"Uh, Rock Strongo."
14166,"Uh, Lance Uppercut."
14167,Let me just put on my glasses.
14168,You're charging how much for a room?
14169,"Hello, this is a phone survey. If the election were held today, would you vote for ""A"" the cops are there, or ""B"" you are free to talk?"
14170,"Oh, Marge. You're not gettin' it, it's me. Homer. Simpson."
14171,"Lisa, this is from your Mom."
14172,"Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. I'm the worst dad in the world."
14173,The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired!
14174,To find out everything about you so I'd seem like a good father.
14175,"Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea."
14176,"Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!"
14177,"Cheer up, honey, we're living an all natural existence, the kind you like. Ooh, a trash can. We'll find breakfast in here."
14178,"Oh, a banana!"
14179,It's full of cigarette butts. So is this one...
14180,We'll just tell the police and then I'm back to being plain old Rock Strongo.
14181,Dexter Colt. The man who framed my daughter.
14182,"In retrospect, yes."
14183,I'll just hide here.
14184,Now what are you gonna do? You can't shoot all of us.
14185,Damn it!
14186,"Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!"
14187,How ironic. Now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
14188,"Well, it wasn't easy, honey, but I'm glad you love me again."
14189,Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals?
14190,"Don't worry, honey. I released them all into the wild."
14191,"Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there..."
14192,How the mighty have fallen... into my price range. I wanna go there!
14193,Woo hoo!
14194,What do I do now?
14195,"No, I'm good."
14196,"Hey, your early porno movies! Are any of these hetero?"
14197,Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?
14198,The weights that changed you from a Bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?
14199,I'll take it.
14200,"No, no worries. This is what all those hours of playing Tetris were for."
14201,Perfect!
14202,Do you think you could give me a lift home?
14203,Your heartbeat is so soothing.
14204,It's all my fault my wife got mugged.
14205,"Wait Marge, I don't want you to leave the house without this."
14206,"Emergency whistle, pepper spray and this map of the most vulnerable parts of a man's body."
14207,"Oh, like I'm gonna kick Chief Wiggum in the groin."
14208,Now Dr. Hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.
14209,Don't worry. Everything is fine. What the hell is that?
14210,"It's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!"
14211,"Don't worry, I'll set fire to the hive."
14212,Run!
14213,"Yep, but you're still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu..."
14214,"Look, I'm the first to admit it. I don't write good parts for women."
14215,"Kids, I'll go find your mother."
14216,"Dad, we're canceling the rest of the play."
14217,Marge?
14218,"Listen kids, your Mom is going to be living in the basement. But with our love, she'll get better soon."
14219,Then we'll have to smoke her out.
14220,"Why you little... oh, hi Jesus. I was just..."
14221,"Wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! Isn't it, kids?"
14222,"Bart, eat your spinach."
14223,Yes way!
14224,"It's like we're at Cheers. I loved that show. Because you always knew it was only a half hour till ""Wings."" Then you could just sleep till Monday."
14225,Ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! I'm married to Joey Heatherton.
14226,"No, actually, I'm going to eat twice as much."
14227,"Alright Mom! / Yay, Mom! / Woo hoo!"
14228,"Marge, that was amazing! It's like I'm married to Shaft."
14229,I'd rather talk about our feelings. I feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. Rebuttal?
14230,"Listen, my bulky flower, I-I have an early day..."
14231,'Mornin' kids! I made your lunches. They're on the table.
14232,Your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.
14233,Ow... Ow... Ow... Oww...
14234,"Quiet, her muscular ears can hear us."
14235,"Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey. You bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity."
14236,"Sorry, sir, sorry."
14237,Denser?!
14238,Marge?
14239,"Somewhere in that sea of bull hormones is the sweet, wonderful girl I married. The woman who instead of swatting a fly, will give it a bath and send it on its way. I'd sure like to go home and have Jiffy Pop with her."
14240,And I miss being your knight in flabby armor.
14241,"Ready for a real workout, Marge?"
14242,Good. Can you wax the car? Ow! Ow! Ow! I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
14243,"Yeah, well, nachos are nachos."
14244,"Wow, I wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that."
14245,Mmm... Farfetched.
14246,Yes...
14247,Yes...
14248,Woo hoo!
14249,Huh?
14250,I think my leg is broken.
14251,"Well, I guess Flanders doesn't have all the luck."
14252,It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
14253,They thought of everything! How come all the good things happen to Jesus H. Nice? By which I mean Flanders!
14254,The grass is actually greener on Flanders' side.
14255,"No that's not it. He's got some secret. And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes."
14256,"Flanders, what's your secret? You never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""Mr. Blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. It sickens me."
14257,"So that's all it takes, a little prayer."
14258,"Ugh, where's the remote?"
14259,"Well, since I don't have the remote, I can just get up and change the channel."
14260,Wait a minute. I'll do what Flanders does.
14261,"O, Merciful God, who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder, help me find the remote."
14262,There it is.
14263,"Die, monster!"
14264,"It worked! I got my wish! From now on, I'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding."
14265,"O Lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz."
14266,Yes!
14267,Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God. I could do this all day. And I just might. Vengeful God / Loving God. Vengeful God / Loving God.
14268,"You know, I used to think God only helped professional athletes and Grammy winners. But now I realize he helps shmoes like me, too, Carl."
14269,"Dear Lord, as I think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, I am reminded of Colonel Sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. Lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? I command you!"
14270,Mmm. Move over eggs. Bacon just got a new best friend: Fudge.
14271,"Oh heavenly God, my son is plagued with homework. With your vast knowledge of the shore birds of Maryland, I know you can help him."
14272,Can and will. Now to un-stop this sink.
14273,"Lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. Then take some time off for yourself. Fly to France. Have a nice dinner."
14274,"Oh Lord, I see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, Marge. For thou art most wise..."
14275,"Marge, he's way the Hell up there."
14276,"Well, we could live with a stopped-up drain."
14277,You was hiding behind the drywall. Yes you were! I'm glad Social Services didn't see this. Yes I am!
14278,"Ooh, you coughed up some dry wall."
14279,So that's your answer! I'll sue the church!
14280,It wouldn't be the first time.
14281,I couldn't help it. Those pews are so comfortable.
14282,Can I borrow your pen to sign this deposition?
14283,I can't see anything in this fog.
14284,"Woo-hoo! Can I get that in lottery tickets, please?"
14285,"He's not giving it to me, God is. Because I prayed for it."
14286,It's all good.
14287,"Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?"
14288,"The dog's on board, too."
14289,Aw... he thinks he's papal.
14290,Sweet.
14291,"Oh, I love this song."
14292,"I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU, BABY / YOU WERE MADE FOR LOVING ME..."
14293,"I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU, BABY..."
14294,We'll just see about that.
14295,"I'm so sorry for all your horrible problems, but this is our dog's room now."
14296,"You're right, Marge. I'll make it up to them. By throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!"
14297,"Bless you, bless you, how you doin'?"
14298,She went to Lovejoy's temporary church. She's worried about her immortal soul.
14299,"Eh, God's cool."
14300,"Oh look, God's giving us a little shower."
14301,"Everybody, look at the much-needed rain. Thank you, God. Now turn the rainwater into wine."
14302,"Oh, wet and wonderful God, your flood has driven us to the roof of your church. Surely this has proven whatever point you had."
14303,God's ignoring me.
14304,I guess I learned something here. God is capable of great anger and great mercy. But mostly great anger.
14305,It's such a mess. Watch the teeth!
14306,I was going to tell you on my deathbed.
14307,La la la la la la la la la.
14308,La la la la la la la. Nothing left. La la la... la... la.
14309,I needed it. I had to buy back some incriminating photos.
14310,Look. See. You're fine. And then--oops! Uh-oh. Look out...
14311,"I know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, Daddy's a hero!"
14312,"See, Bart. I saved you."
14313,That's okay. His cute little hands can't even fit around my neck.
14314,Now he's got it.
14315,"That's right. You're mine till you're eighteen. And when you're seventeen I'm gonna know the end is near, so I'm gonna work you like a dog."
14316,"Yes, son. At times like this I just look at my bracelet."
14317,Jesus?! I thought it was Gepetto!
14318,Who is it?
14319,"Well, I'm not opening the door."
14320,Is it crispy?
14321,But not too crispy.
14322,See you in court.
14323,Emancipated? Don't you like being a dude?
14324,"Hey, my dad was lousy and I didn't sue him. I just dumped him in the cheapest home I could find."
14325,"Why you little...! Um, I'm sorry, Judge. That's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor."
14326,Why you little...!
14327,Why you little...! Why you little...!
14328,"Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can."
14329,Woo hoo! You're still mine! And you thought I was a bad dad before.
14330,Mmmmm... garnish.
14331,What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?
14332,I'll show you worse!
14333,I was told this would be televised!
14334,"Go ahead, leave. You'll come crawling back."
14335,That's right! Crawling on your knees!
14336,"Crawling! Oh, he's really gone. He's gone!"
14337,"Look out, son. This one's got a little mustard on it!"
14338,Attaboy! We just won the World Series! You and me together! Yeah!
14339,"Of all the sites on all the web, I had to click onto his."
14340,"Did you see that, boy? Your mom thinks you're still here!"
14341,"For your information, I've been taking steps to become a better father."
14342,For the past week I've been carrying around this bag of sugar. It's taught me how to love and care for a child.
14343,What the-- where the hell is my sugar?!
14344,"Hello, son. You're looking well."
14345,"Of course, because you wouldn't want to... I paid for your splendor, you...!"
14346,Do it without the attitude or don't do it at all.
14347,"You know son, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I was wrong to exploit you, and I won't do it again."
14348,"So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?"
14349,"Psst, Mr. Hawk. May I have a word with you?"
14350,Sure. My son is Bart Simpson and...
14351,Sorry. I just wanna win my son back so badly.
14352,"Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again."
14353,Groovy.
14354,All the work?
14355,"I'm challenging you, Hawk. In front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it."
14356,Not very!
14357,Now to win back my son in comfort and style.
14358,"You know, I could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home."
14359,"Woo hoo! I rule this pseudo sport! Come back to me, boy!"
14360,"Aw, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard, you stupid little kid."
14361,"Finally, someone explains it to me in words I can understand. Look, boy. I know I did wrong and I am truly sorry."
14362,"I put you in humiliating commercials for money, which I spent on myself. I just wish I had an opportunity to make things right."
14363,Anything... as long as I can give the money to my son.
14364,Well... I am bald and important. Where do I sign?
14365,"Well, Kathy, I'll tell you. It's Viagrogaine. It gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. What are you waiting for, loser?"
14366,What did they say about my scalp?
14367,It's nice to see a realistic single woman on TV.
14368,"Wow, I can't wait to pack that into my colon."
14369,"I got arm veins, don't I?"
14370,"Mars, eh? Hmmm, I see no evidence of water."
14371,The Ribwich! The commercials have come to pass!
14372,You seem like an impartial observer. But I've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
14373,I could lick you all day long.
14374,One Ribwich please.
14375,"Hm, now without lettuce."
14376,I have eaten the ribs of God.
14377,"Hey, who doesn't?"
14378,That sounds like a magical family moment. I'm sorry I won't be there.
14379,"Oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. Only very serious Daddy business can tear me from your side."
14380,Three Ribwiches please. And instead of a shake I'd like a blended Ribwich.
14381,"Not again! First you took away my Philly Fudge Steak, and then my Bacon Balls, then my Whatcha-ma-chicken. You monster!"
14382,"I'd like a large fries, please. And a collector's cup."
14383,"Wow, this is amazing. I could follow the Ribwich from town to town."
14384,"Maybe I should hook up with you guys. After all, how long do any of us have to live?"
14385,You monster! Why did you expel Boogerman?
14386,That was awesome!
14387,"I'm sorry, honey. I can't be here tomorrow. It's the last day the Ribwich is in San Francisco."
14388,You don't understand. It's not just a sandwich. It's about brotherhood. It's about freedom. It's about three days since I've had one! I'm getting the shakes... and I'm getting the fries!
14389,This can only be good.
14390,Hey! Don't Borgnine my sandwich.
14391,The pig?
14392,"Welcome to the real world, hippies!"
14393,"Lisa? Is this what I've come to? Fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? Mister, I'll take that car."
14394,"Daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!"
14395,Damn right honey. You're number one on my menu. Now super-size it!
14396,"Yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car."
14397,It came out again.
14398,"Enough talk. Dip me, my love."
14399,Lower. Lower!
14400,Lower!
14401,"I know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. There's the Tongue-Kissing Festival... Cinco de Ocho... The Hobo Oscars... days just made for lovers. Not widowers, lovers."
14402,Flanders?! Can't a man just drink alone on a Wednesday morning?
14403,Ooh! Lemme guess. Skinner's mother. She sure knows how to swing it.
14404,Sara Sloane? The movie star?
14405,"Flanders, I mix Twinkies and Ding Dongs all the time. In Europe they call it a Dinkie."
14406,Now wait just a minute -- I used to worry Marge was too good for me. She was always thinking of ways to improve me. But then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. So we're all where we want to be.
14407,"Who the hell is Mr. Flanders? Oh, Flanders."
14408,"Hello? Yes, I'm Ned Flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. Oh yes, I she does look pregnant. Now, who might you be? A tabloid? Is that one of those really strong mints? Hello? Hello?"
14409,"Hey, don't blame me, I voted for the green M&M."
14410,"Moe, what are you doing here?"
14411,Stupid Flanders. I'm not giving you any of my secret moves.
14412,"Look, Flanders. I'm always interested in talking about free milk. And if there's cookies involved, so much the better."
14413,"Poor Ned, gardening away his misery."
14414,Me too.
14415,Uh-oh. Here comes Helen Fielding.
14416,Droll.
14417,Mmm... promo.
14418,"Ew, Fox!"
14419,Do - you - hear - a - noise?
14420,Marge germs!
14421,I'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave.
14422,Tissues please!
14423,Get... out of my... airspace!
14424,I'm on my way. You man the rake.
14425,It was an application to open a Cinnabon stand.
14426,Never!
14427,Stay plugged in! I will find you!
14428,"Now Cookie, do you think you can sell this house?"
14429,"See, it all works out?"
14430,Make that a chocolate milk and you've got a deal.
14431,That's a great idea. Why didn't you say something before?
14432,What?
14433,I SEE A BAD MOON RISING...
14434,LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN FOR NASTY WEATHER...
14435,I guess there's only one way out of our problems: a murder/suicide pact.
14436,"It's just an expression, Marge."
14437,"Eh, I'm still undecided."
14438,Bo-ring!
14439,Let him speak!
14440,"Krusty, you've let everyone down. And even worse, you've let down this sacred document."
14441,Stained with the blood of American patriots.
14442,From the unknown toaster.
14443,Yeah. And to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
14444,"Beat it, Waxie."
14445,"Sir, I studied under Ed McMahon!"
14446,How 'bout before?
14447,You call this a bicameral legislature?
14448,"I say, I say... my groin!"
14449,That's right. Over the homes of poor people.
14450,"So kids, its Valentine's Day, and you know what that means -- you get to stay downstairs watching TV with the sound turned way up."
14451,"Oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire."
14452,"Children, so naïve."
14453,I didn't say anything. So naïve.
14454,"Oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. Have some more liquor."
14455,"That's it, drink up my pretty."
14456,"Thanks for the love tip, ""60 Minutes II."""
14457,"Mm, funky!"
14458,"Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood. I ate your granny and now I'm in the mood for love."
14459,But it's St. Valentine's Day! God wants us to do it.
14460,"Well, my special mix tape will get you going."
14461,"Oh, no! That's Maggie's mix tape! Then Maggie must have gotten..."
14462,Shot down on Valentine's Day. That's supposed to be a gimme. Everybody's gettin'some but me.
14463,Everyone but me.
14464,Marge doesn't think I'm sexy. What am I supposed to do?
14465,"Suicide, eh?"
14466,"That's it! Thank you, outdoor advertising! You saved my marriage -- and not for the first time."
14467,"""Releasing your inner screenplay,"" ""Create an online kennel,"" ooh, ""Strip for your wife!"""
14468,Dr. Hibbert? You're the teacher?
14469,Three coats.
14470,Aren't you gonna chuckle?
14471,Nobody loves oily Homer...
14472,You know everything about me!
14473,Wipe me down and sign me up!
14474,"You're preaching to the choir, man."
14475,"Uh, well, I drew it on... See..."
14476,"Oooh, published by Kinko's!"
14477,Yes!
14478,Yes!
14479,God yes!
14480,"Tip one, ""Live each day like it was your last."""
14481,I don't wanna die! I'm so young.
14482,"Tip two, ""Let nothing stand in your way."""
14483,"Listen up, ""life obstacles."" From now on, nothing's gonna stand in Homer Simpson's way!"
14484,Do your homework!
14485,Don't do so much homework!
14486,Learn to talk!
14487,"You, let's love. Now!"
14488,Go on ahead. I'll just slow you down.
14489,"It's the sound of a go-getter at work, Marge. Look, I installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are."
14490,"I finally harnessed the awesome power of the hook. Well, time for work."
14491,"Megatronics Tip twenty: ""Make your cubicle into a you-bicle."""
14492,"Hmm. What next, Megatronics? ""Point out problems at your workplace to your boss. To separate yourself from the herd, just tattle on the cattle. Hm."
14493,And now to see Mr. Burns for the promotion and raise I've deserved since this morning.
14494,"Mr. Burns, I've made a list of recommendations to improve plant efficiency."
14495,But the book said you would applaud my initiative.
14496,"Yes, sir."
14497,"Ahhh, look at the little eels. Electric eels!"
14498,"Well, he does. All my life I've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. Mr. Burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" No, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."
14499,"Thanks for trying, but I'll be at Moe's."
14500,I gave Mr. Burns the best years of my life. And how much respect does he give me?
14501,"Moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years."
14502,Revenge? On Mr. Burns?
14503,"No, I think this calls for something a little more cerebral."
14504,Wait'll he steps on this flaming bag of... Lisa's college fund?!
14505,Get rid of a bird? No way. Their eyes are so expressive.
14506,Why are you looking at me like that?
14507,"I have a plan to get to the top, but I have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. I'm not sure I could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal."
14508,"This is it, boy. With this bird gone, the plant will be mine for the taking."
14509,Mr. Burns! The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is here for a surprise inspection!
14510,Hello!
14511,Hello!
14512,Hello!
14513,Hello!
14514,"That's right. And as my first act... Mr. Burns, you're fired!"
14515,"No, it's entirely within my power. Furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. Check and mate. Now, king me!"
14516,Huh?
14517,Mr. Burns?
14518,"Eat crowd, old man!"
14519,"Hey, that looks fun! Do me!"
14520,Mr. Burns' reign of terror is over.
14521,And today begins my reign of terr--
14522,... iffic management!
14523,"Unlike Mr. Burns, I will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. And now, as I ascend this crystal staircase to my office, I say: avert your gaze!"
14524,"That is so cool. Bart, open the door."
14525,"Now, open it again and put a walnut in there."
14526,You're right. Put two walnuts in there.
14527,"Sweetie, these things are gonna take time. I just found the door-shutting thing."
14528,"Oh! Oh, yeah."
14529,I need a vacation.
14530,Can't I water ski a little bit?
14531,No deal!
14532,"That's great, honey. Hold it up to the camera."
14533,"Look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. I f..."
14534,...best quality pork chops.
14535,"Lisa, I deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce."
14536,"Well, I have to work, but give the monitor a kiss."
14537,"C'mon, boy. You're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor."
14538,"Hey! That's a printer port, not a finger hole."
14539,"Hey, honey. Sorry I'm so late. I had to lay off twenty-seven robots. Don't tell me they can't cry."
14540,Bart's growing up without me. He won't be ten forever.
14541,Mr. Burns! Where's Mr. Smithers?
14542,"How did you ever run this place? You've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon..."
14543,"Yes, yes. If I keep putting work first, I'll lose everyone I care about, just like you did."
14544,"Thank you, Mr. Burns. Thank you for... huh?"
14545,What are you doin'?
14546,I don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. I don't even want it.
14547,There you go.
14548,"From now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest Dad."
14549,Quit crowding the plate!
14550,"Oh, you want a piece of me?"
14551,Yeah.
14552,Ow! Ow! He bit me! You saw him! He bit me! You little...
14553,"No, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer."
14554,Talking won't get you there.
14555,"Lisa, what's bumming you out? They cancel a test or something?"
14556,It's a concern. A serious concern.
14557,"Sweetie, Daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check."
14558,Boi-oi-oi-oinggg!
14559,"No, of course not!"
14560,Duh-uh.
14561,I have to go.
14562,Oh my God! Space monsters are invading us!
14563,"Oh. Well, where do I twist this thing to make funny patterns?"
14564,"You may be a smart kid, Lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings."
14565,Mmm... bad eggs.
14566,Hey Mr. Smithers!
14567,It's this new anti-crime dealie. The mayor turned the streetlights way up. My daughter Lisa feels really strongly about it.
14568,"I'unno. What am I, Superdad?"
14569,I'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.
14570,"Don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?"
14571,Aw... my baby's first words.
14572,Night... glorious night...
14573,I wish God were alive to see this.
14574,I hope it's as fun as Pictionary was last week.
14575,What? Are you sure?
14576,"Oh, that takes me back."
14577,"Oh, I hate this. It's making me use my arms."
14578,Hey! These two pieces were already connected -- we're halfway there!
14579,Can't help you -- all I got is gray. Anybody working on a cement wall?
14580,"Oh, right. Chinese guy, Chinese guy, frisbee dog..."
14581,It's how the pros do it.
14582,Now let's see. This is either an old coconut... or Tom Hayden.
14583,It's the only worthwhile thing I ever made that wasn't Lisa.
14584,"Prove me wrong, Silent Bob."
14585,Looks like you're missing a wife.
14586,"Or when I messed up taping ""City Slickers 2"" and cut off the end. Was Curly's gold just a legend?"
14587,"Puzzle piece, come out and play-ay."
14588,"Hey, what's this? ""Marge's Memory Chest."""
14589,"Aww, Marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out. The fake business card I made up to impress her..."
14590,T-shirt from our first rock concert...
14591,Moe's Tavern Grand Opening... That was back when his floors were sticky with promise.
14592,I can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.
14593,"Hey, there's writing on the back of this."
14594,"""Dear Homer, I can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life."""
14595,The only dangerous amount is none!
14596,Let's go to IHOP! I'm drivin'.
14597,"Okay, Burger King! Whatever! C'mon."
14598,"Why did she stay with me if she hated me so much? Hey, two days later she had a doctor's appointment."
14599,"Nausea... cravings... knocked-up feeling... She was pregnant with Bart! And that's the reason she stayed with me.,nausea cravings knocked-up feeling she was pregnant with bart and thats the reason she stayed with me,17

14600,Yeah.
14601,Yeah.
14602,Whatever.
14603,Marge... did I ruin your life?
14604,"No, the voters will decide that in November. I was talking about this."
14605,"More like, where didn't I find it. It was practically everywhere."
14606,Quit changing the subject. How do you feel about me right now?
14607,So you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?
14608,Fine. I'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.
14609,That was a muffin!
14610,"Oh, I get it. Your stupid husband is too ""drunk"" to do it right."
14611,"Oh, so you don't like it when I drink. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?"
14612,"Oh, I didn't realize you've been counting the years. Is it that horrible living with me?"
14613,"It is to me! Marge, I can't live like this! I'm tired of walking around on eggshells."
14614,Now you're just making up rules. Who made you Judge Judy and executioner?
14615,"Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think."
14616,"No, no. This is nothing like Milhouse's parents. Now if you need me I'll be staying with Milhouse's father."
14617,You don't have a doorknob.
14618,Do I dare to go up? Or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?
14619,"Stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette. Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and... hey, I never noticed that newspaper box."
14620,"""Apartment Finder: We put you in your place."" ""Roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. Spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" Thank you, news box... It's gone!"
14621,What a well-kept street. And there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.
14622,It's a cinch these guys never had any kids.
14623,"What's the deal with this place? It's so manly, yet scented."
14624,"Nice to meet you, Stuart."
14625,"Me too. I'm a member of this club where if I eat one more sub sandwich, I get a free sub sandwich. You probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly."
14626,Are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?
14627,"You are? Hm, which will win out? My old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that I've already mixed my laundry with yours. I'll have to sleep on it."
14628,"You guys lead a fascinating life. Like, why are you reading the New York Times? You don't live in New York."
14629,"Calm down, Picky Ricardo. He made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way."
14630,"Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm gonna stay."
14631,Way ahead of you.
14632,I see.
14633,"Marge, please. Let's not fight in front of the kids. Just secretly hate me the way you always have."
14634,Why you little...!
14635,You noticed! I've been using Lancôme.
14636,"Well, I'd better go. But before I do, Marge, there's something I want to ask you."
14637,How much do you tip a leg waxer? I need to know by tomorrow!
14638,"The kids are cool, but Marge is still judging me."
14639,"Maybe it is. I used to look at Marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see Rip Taylor. But now, I don't know what's gonna happen. C'mon, let's dance."
14640,Tennessee Williams?! But how did he survive in the world of theater?
14641,Weird Al Yankovic!
14642,Did you ever get the parody songs I sent you?
14643,"Which one was better: ""Livin' La Pizza Loca"" or ""Another One Bites The Crust""?"
14644,"Yeah, like you and Allan Sherman."
14645,It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
14646,I don't know... date a chick with kids...
14647,"All right, all right."
14648,Wait a minute... Marge likes a little bit of stubble.
14649,Uh-oh. Gotta even it out.
14650,Margarita... that's Mexican for Marge. I'll take that as a sign!
14651,"I've learned a lot living here. It doesn't matter what someone's sexual preferences are, unless they're a celebrity, in which case it's dish, dish, dish!"
14652,"You guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?"
14653,I gotta go.
14654,Sorry I'm late -- the Velvet Mafia made me a Margarita I couldn't refuse.
14655,"But it was Marge. My first and only love. I'm like David Spade without Chris Farley, alone and useless!"
14656,Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!
14657,"You know, Moe, I was just thinking. My problems with Marge started because I drink too much. And then tonight alcohol only made things worse. Maybe all of my problems are actually caused by..."
14658,"Oh, yeah. The night that destroyed my marriage."
14659,You have that on tape?!
14660,"So, she didn't hate me. She married me because she loved me!"
14661,"Marge, I never want to be apart from you again."
14662,That is the best kiss I've had tonight.
14663,Manly thoughts.
14664,Or was it?
14665,Those suck. They're worse than nothing. I could write way better songs.
14666,"That's it, I'm writing a Christmas carol. If I can make my own clothes, I can do anything."
14667,CHRISTMAS IN DECEMBER / WOW WOW WOW / GIVE ME TONS OF PRESENTS / NOW NOW NOW!
14668,Maybe.
14669,"Flanders, I am a patient, reasonable, handsome man. But even I have my limits. Now beat it!"
14670,How am I supposed to write a song with that stupid jerk bothering me all the time... Wait a minute...
14671,EVERYBODY IN THE USA / HATES THEIR STUPID NEIGHBOR / HE'S FLANDERS AND HE'S REALLY REALLY LAME / FLANDERS TRIED TO WRECK MY SONG / HIS VIEWS ON BIRTH CONTROL ARE WRONG / I HATE HIS GUTS AND FLANDERS IS HIS NAME.
14672,HE'S THE MAN THAT I HATE BEST / I'D LIKE TO SEE HIS HOUSE GO UP IN FLAME!
14673,"Hey, Mister? If you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? It's already rewound."
14674,Fine.
14675,His name is Ned!
14676,Ned's a stupid name! HE'S WORSE THAN FRANKENSTEIN OR DR. NO.
14677,Don't yell at Ned!
14678,His wife is dead!
14679,EVERYBODY HATES THAT STUPID JERK!
14680,"HE'S YOUR PERKY, PEPPY NIGHTMARE NEIGHBORINO!"
14681,IF YOU DESPISE POLITE LEFT-HANDERS...
14682,"Hey, what are we gonna wear tomorrow?"
14683,Me too -- I've come to hate my own creation. Now I know how God feels.
14684,"Well, I guess we could afford one nice trip."
14685,"What? It said ""take one."""
14686,Sweet.
14687,And fight the crowds? Forget it. The Simpsons are going to Bart's idea!
14688,This dude ranch is gonna be great -- a whole week without hearing that stupid song.
14689,Those poor hats.
14690,"Coming, sweetie!"
14691,Can you shoot one where I'm Rambo and my wife is Betty Boop?
14692,"You people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. If I get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?"
14693,How many decks will your blackjack dealers use?
14694,Three.
14695,Deal. My brother...
14696,"All right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble Native Americans can reclaim the land that is theirs."
14697,No! I wanted to die choking on food!
14698,"So long, suckers!"
14699,Stop shoving! The little one isn't getting any.
14700,/ Let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... Wind should be coming in from the south... Time it to coincide with a beaver holiday...
14701,This map is useless! Useless!
14702,It's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. What are you gonna do?
14703,"Check it out, beavers. Delicious motel furniture!"
14704,Uh-oh! We forgot to empty the mini-bar!
14705,That's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!
14706,"Quick, find the master log! There's always a master log."
14707,"We did it! Finally, man has triumphed over a small, furry animal!"
14708,Fresca?!
14709,"Look at those stupid city slickers, with their fur coats and pointy hats."
14710,I still hate them. Go back to Pittsburgh!
14711,A lot can happen when you're lookin' the other way.
14712,Who is he?!
14713,"Woo hoo! In your face, imaginary guy!"
14714,"Don't worry, son. I'll build you a new treehouse. One so grand it'll be an affront to God himself."
14715,Only if it's an affront to God.
14716,Only losers buy wood. We're going to nature's lumberyard.
14717,"It's okay, Bart. This track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh."
14718,Nothing beats flying across the country on a train.
14719,Did Frank Lloyd Wright have to deal with people like you?
14720,"Look, I have no idea who Frank Lloyd Wright is."
14721,I was just puttin' words together.
14722,"Well, two can play at that game."
14723,Stop it!
14724,"Son, that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever. It really restores your faith in helpful weirdos."
14725,"Heck no, the Amish did it. Who knows more about electricity than the Amish?"
14726,"Watch your step... Don't panic... By going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue."
14727,Head burning... legs freezing. Middle... very pleasant.
14728,"Oh thank God, the dog's here! Pull me free, boy."
14729,"Don't be scared, you can do it!"
14730,Hey! Where are you goin'? I'm your pal! I took you for a walk once!
14731,Flames? Searing pain? A black cat? I must be in heaven.
14732,Move the net under the window.
14733,I always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty.
14734,"But as for you, Santa's Little Helper, you are a selfish coward and a bad dog!"
14735,"Get out, and stay out."
14736,"Quit following me, you coward!"
14737,"All my life, Kent. I prefer ""catsup"" to ""ketchup."" And to me, ""Yusuf Islam"" will always be ""Cat Stevens."""
14738,"God no, it sucks."
14739,"Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog."
14740,Hmm... needs beer.
14741,Why you little...!
14742,Fine.
14743,"I want you to just sit there, look through the window and watch me eat a ham. Marge, prepare the emergency ham."
14744,"I don't care if his name is Bony McDork, just make the checks out to me."
14745,Corporate jet?
14746,Sweet.
14747,"Welcome back to the family, boy."
14748,"Who are you, my biographer?"
14749,"Boy, you're now second best in the family, right ahead of Marge."
14750,"Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog."
14751,My wads! I never even broke the wrapper.
14752,"Aww. There, there, boy. I'll help you get him back. He may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a Simpson that isn't."
14753,"All right, you're not a coward. And that's beside the point because--"
14754,"A plan, eh? Okay, we'll use a plan."
14755,Help! Help! I'm drowning!
14756,Everything is going according to plan. I'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.
14757,"Now let me think. How did that beautiful young naked lady in ""Jaws"" make it out alive?"
14758,"I'm sorry I was ever mean to you. Marge, prepare the celebration ham."
14759,"Marge, they're just hams, okay."
14760,"Well, boy, now that we got you back, I'm never gonna let you go again."
14761,"To me that says ""I love you."""
14762,"Aw, it was probably that stupid cat."
14763,What has he done for me lately?
14764,"Yeah, but he ate the last can of tuna."
14765,Everyone's against me.
14766,"Bart, are you okay?"
14767,"Hey, take it easy. I went to the video store, to rent a movie for the family..."
14768,That monkey's wearin' a hat.
14769,"Look, he's misspelling words."
14770,"You can't just ""get"" a cell phone."
14771,Can I get a phone that plays the Mexican Hat Dance?
14772,"I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AROUND A MEXICAN HAT / I DANCE, I DANCE, I DANCE / AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT / OR IS IT I GUESS I'LL KEEP SINGING / MY CELL PHONE APPEARS TO BE RINGING..."
14773,"Barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?"
14774,"Hands-free, eh? Then I could give the brothers the black power salute."
14775,Black power! Black power!
14776,Uh... a lighter.
14777,I'll take 'em.
14778,DVD player? Check. Snow-cone machine? Check. Lite Brite?
14779,Check. Fog machine?
14780,Even I think this is crazy.
14781,"CHAKA KHAN, LET ME ROCK YOU / LET ME ROCK YOU, CHAKA KHAN / CHAKA KHAN CHAKA KHAN..."
14782,Oh my God! I've got to do something.
14783,"Come on, transmit. Transmit!"
14784,Save me Chaka Khan! Chaka Khannnn!
14785,I'll never mock the Coast Guard again. You Navy rejects are all right!
14786,"I am so screwed. I can't drive to work, I can't drive to the store, and I certainly can't drive to the store at work."
14787,"That reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in Shelbyville."
14788,I didn't want them to know my size.
14789,"Thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, Marge."
14790,Where is your mother? I've gotta get to Moe's.
14791,Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. I guess I'll walk.
14792,"Stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. I miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me!"
14793,I did it. I walked all the way to Moe's from my house.
14794,"You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar."
14795,"No. From now on, walking is my beer. And feeling good is my hangover."
14796,"You know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy I am."
14797,You see? I'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.
14798,"You see? Before, I probably would have driven to the syrup."
14799,"Calm down, Stresserella!"
14800,"Now now, honey. We all appreciate what you do. But real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. You could get in a lot of trouble with the Livery Commission."
14801,"Marge, you don't know what you're saying!"
14802,What a day for a stroll.
14803,Look at those suckers in their metal coffins. I can go to work any way I want.
14804,Psst. Bishop to queen four.
14805,"I said, ""Bishop to queen four."""
14806,"Thanks, Mr. Burns. I owe it all to walking."
14807,How 'bout we take a family walk around the block?
14808,"Honey, you seem frazzled. Why don't you come with us?"
14809,You sure love driving.
14810,It sure has. You see this bulge back here?
14811,Now it actually is a fanny pack.
14812,"No, wait. It's still my ass. But your point is well taken. You see..."
14813,I LIKE TO WALK DOWN THE AVENUE / BUST A MOVE WITH DISCO STU...
14814,"YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD..."
14815,I RARELY FEEL THE NEED TO UTTER D'OH!
14816,"Top of the mornin', ladies."
14817,I CAN WALK FROM SPRINGFIELD TO ALASKA / THEN HOBNOB WITH THE STARS IN MALIBU...
14818,"The guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""Fargo""?"
14819,AND WHEN I HEAR...
14820,"I SAY ""OF COURSE I CAN -- SCREW YOU!"""
14821,"OH, I LOVE TO PERAMBULATE / IT'S STANDING STILL I REALLY HATE / SO LET ME PLEASE REITERATE / I LOVE TO..."
14822,My feet are inside me.
14823,Pretty good. Thanks for asking.
14824,"It's okay, Marge. It would have been a lot worse if I hadn't been carrying this Bible in my crotch."
14825,Too hot! Too hot!
14826,"Hot! Hot! Hot! Warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!"
14827,"Yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever."
14828,"Marge, you're trying to hurt me!"
14829,"No, it's true. The car, the soup... It's like you hate me... your own husband..."
14830,"I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you."
14831,"Who's ""we""? Got a mouse in your purse?"
14832,Nothing could be farther from the...
14833,"You could be on to something there, Doc..."
14834,"Sorry, I got a lot on my mind."
14835,"There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson... and Commander Cool, a/k/a me."
14836,"We've gotta help her. If Marge isn't happy, I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy Moe is very happy. But for once, this isn't about Moe. What should I do, Dr. Hot Dog?"
14837,You mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
14838,I see. Do you have any suggestions?
14839,Here's a dollar.
14840,Gotta go.
14841,"I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings."
14842,You can bring a bag of ice.
14843,Pick one.
14844,"Honey, I couldn't keep 'em away if I tried. Except for Flanders. He was mysteriously called out of town."
14845,"Tonight, we're here to serve you. Sit back and enjoy the finest foods Springfield has to offer."
14846,That I fixed with new words!
14847,SO I THREW YOU A FANCY BANQUET / AND NOW YOU CAN'T STAY MAD / HOW 'BOUT A MAKE-UP SNUGGLE? / IT WOULD BE SO RAD.
14848,So you don't want to kill me anymore?
14849,Now I'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return.
14850,Why you little...
14851,"Now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to Marge!"
14852,"You're welcome. And now Marge, we cooked, you clean."
14853,"Only teasing. We've flown in the finest busboys from France... I mean, America!"
14854,"And now, to all my dear friends, I say... get the Hell out of my yard."
14855,I AM HOMER TRIBAL CHIEF / I AM WEARING TINY BRIEFS / BRAVES TEACH VALUE BOYS SHOULD KNOW / NOW EXTENDED DRUM SO-LO
14856,I never knew you were such a Beatles fan.
14857,It's not all his fault. I blame this latchkey kid.
14858,"Look at me, I'm Brian Epstein!"
14859,"Now I'm Michael Jackson. I own all your songs, losers. Hee, hee, hee."
14860,Five-H?
14861,"Hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. ""Cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."""
14862,You mean like some sort of madman?
14863,I'll do it!
14864,I will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.
14865,"Let's see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War."
14866,"The noble Chiefs outsmarted the treacherous Cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. Unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. I shall bet no more forever."
14867,"Without the talking stick, we don't hear you."
14868,"But I was chosen by the Great Spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, I'll be at Moe's talking normal."
14869,"Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?"
14870,"Uh, I'm giving it back to the earth."
14871,"Marge, you were an excellent peace-time Chief. But these times call for men of cruelty."
14872,"Oh, it's too tight! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!"
14873,Men of cruelty.
14874,"Okay, Bart. Back up the truck."
14875,It's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
14876,Wait a minute. How could those stupid jar-heads win?
14877,Well I'm not finished. Where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
14878,"Marge, remove that stitching."
14879,People will do anything a sign tells them.
14880,"Boy, that slaked my thirst."
14881,Or did it?
14882,You talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!
14883,"Oh my God, that's my wife, and she's crying."
14884,How come Lisa always gets to pick the family activities?
14885,That's because there were seven apostles.
14886,"Boy, that's a big staff. And still he wasn't that funny."
14887,Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.
14888,"Ooo, a hotdog!"
14889,Flower power my ass.
14890,"So long, suckers!"
14891,Woo-hoo! Pedal to the metal!
14892,Your baby!
14893,NOOOOOOOOOO!
14894,Moe! Thank God you saved my baby...
14895,"Look, Maggie's in the paper with Moe. How cute."
14896,Look at those pants. They're standing up with no one in them.
14897,"Oh my God, I'm late for work."
14898,"It's Patty, chump!"
14899,"Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!"
14900,"No way! I'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, I'm oh-for-three. I've gotta get her back."
14901,"I said, pipe down, Amtrak."
14902,"Back off, Moe. Maggie wants to be with me."
14903,This is how we play. THE SQUIRMY WORMY SPIDER / SQUIRTS OUT OF DADDY'S HANDS...
14904,... DADDY FEELS REJECTED / HE'S GONNA EAT SOME CAKE.
14905,I peed my pants.
14906,I recorded that for private use!
14907,Your turn.
14908,Moe?! What are you doing here?
14909,"That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore."
14910,"Get your own family, Moe."
14911,Get out!
14912,Get out!
14913,"Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own."
14914,What are you screaming about? Did you discover my snake farm? 'Cause I can explain. I'm going to farm and sell snakes.
14915,It must have been Moe!
14916,Thank goodness.
14917,"Uh, no, that was me."
14918,I'll get our little passports.
14919,"Oh my God, I've gotta save her!"
14920,"We're not. Your sleeve got caught on that tree. Here, let me unhook ya."
14921,Off you go.
14922,"Or worse, am I right?"
14923,"Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham."
14924,"You kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! Eat fire, punks!"
14925,Never!
14926,Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps.
14927,Death? We don't want any.
14928,This is for Snowball One and JFK!
14929,Does this mean they'll never cancel the Jim Belushi Show?
14930,Nooooo!
14931,"Death, Death, we miss you so much. You were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the chokies. And you made NASCAR racing exciting."
14932,I'll curb him... without enthusiasm.
14933,"Ooo, this robe's pretty soft."
14934,Check it out! I finally found a dead guy's clothes that fit me!
14935,What? It's not... My hand! What's happening?
14936,"No way. Forget it. I might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but I am not a Grim Reaper."
14937,Ow! I'll reap! I'll reap already!
14938,"Jasper, your time has come!"
14939,Never mind. I'm Death now.
14940,Leave everything to me.
14941,"Pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... Take an dirt nap. Feed the worms..."
14942,Hm.
14943,I'unno.
14944,"Okay, who am I giving the finger to today?"
14945,Not this! Anything but this!
14946,Uh... what was that first one again?
14947,"Okay God, I bumped off the love of my life, according to your divine whim. Now release me from this ghastly vocation."
14948,Come on!
14949,Woo-hoo!
14950,I'm gonna not kill you every week.
14951,Y'ello?
14952,"The Nobel Prize! Finally. So, uh it's for what, my whole deal?"
14953,"If I say no, do I still win?"
14954,I wish I was Death again. That was cool.
14955,Hmm...
14956,I can't go on...
14957,It was those guys!
14958,"Just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?"
14959,Let the baby have her bottle.
14960,Lisa!
14961,"Okay, that's good! Stop there!"
14962,"Yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! Like getting the rat out of Maggie's room!"
14963,This counts as a bath!
14964,Whom? Whom?
14965,"Bart, you're not at school. Don't swear!"
14966,"Honey, this is your moment in the sun. And I couldn't be more pleased for your happiness."
14967,Why was I born?
14968,Oh T-shirt. Bless the loom that fruited you.
14969,Gotta win a T-shirt. Gotta win a T-shirt.
14970,"Okay, get ready to laugh!"
14971,Cranford Man Missing. What's he missing? His pants? A train? Gimme a break!
14972,"Too soon, huh?"
14973,"All right. ""Drought threatens to turn west into dessert""? Yum, yum. I think I'd like some whipped cream on my Wyoming!"
14974,"From what, too much hot fudge? Huh? C'mon Bart, show me some love!"
14975,This is what happens when I go for six hours without sleep.
14976,"""Peace talks break down."" No. ""For sale, Ford Festiva..."" I'll put that in the ""maybes."" I gotta get that T-shirt."
14977,World's Biggest Pizza?!
14978,Oh my God!
14979,"Marge, wake up! The newspaper is talking to me!"
14980,I wish! Look at this headline.
14981,"Someone, or something, knows I love oversized food and short, punchy articles. So they hid a message in the first letter of each line. See: ""HOMER, MEET ME 4TH STREET OVERPASS, MIDNITE."""
14982,Wait a minute. This is today's paper. That meeting is tonight!
14983,"Marge, I don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut."
14984,"All right, I will."
14985,That's why I don't listen to my brain. And away we go!
14986,Psst. Hey pal. Hey buddy. Wake up. Wanna go on an adventure with your old man?
14987,You have no choice.
14988,There's coffee in the thermos.
14989,They all do.
14990,"Hey, the bathroom's a block away."
14991,"Mom? You're back. Just like you were back before, then you left me again. I love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. Oh, what the heck."
14992,"Give me a hug, you."
14993,I know! I'm working my way up to you.
14994,I think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.
14995,"You sure know me, Mom."
14996,I made this when I was five. I had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
14997,"Cora, is there a back way outta here?"
14998,Fine.
14999,"Mom, I swear on your eventual grave I will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. Uh-oh."
15000,"Now, I'm not a man who's good with words..."
15001,"I barely know my mother. And every time I see her, she's taken away again. And when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me."
15002,"I mean, I'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. Hell, I torched a blood bank. One cookie my ass! Please, please, give me back my mommy."
15003,"Oh Mom, I'm so happy! I never want to let you go!"
15004,Woo hoo! I can be a little boy again!
15005,A boy who gets some on the side.
15006,"Dad, you testified against her!"
15007,"Look Mom, look! I'm riding by myself!"
15008,"You weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and I want you to see it."
15009,"Hey guys, I brought my Mom."
15010,"Welcome to your room, Mom. I want you to stay here forever."
15011,Now get out of my house.
15012,No! I can't lose my mother again! Don't take her away!
15013,How do you figure?
15014,You're right. People should only be let out of jail on technicalities.
15015,Candlepin bowling? That's a great idea. We'll play right after I break your grandmother out of prison.
15016,"Okay, boy. Flip through those highway warnings 'til we find one that'll stop that bus."
15017,Next.
15018,Pass.
15019,Bo-ring.
15020,Awww.
15021,"Haw haw, loser!"
15022,"Geez, pal."
15023,"Mom, I love you! I can't let you go to prison!"
15024,"Oh, stop it."
15025,"Take care, ladies. I'm sure you can make it back to the prison on your own."
15026,"Mom, I'm gonna hide you where there's no one around for miles... Disney's California Adventure."
15027,"No, you're my mother and I won't leave you!"
15028,"Yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. But I'm not gonna leave you."
15029,"Ooh, that's lucky."
15030,Brambles! Briars!
15031,Go Mom! You can do it!
15032,Nooo!
15033,Bear?!
15034,Your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. But at least now I'll never lose you again.
15035,"I couldn't sleep, because I thought there might be a sign of my Mom in one of these articles. They never did find her body."
15036,"Last week's garbage. I missed the pick-up date. But it doesn't matter, because my Mom is alive. See?"
15037,"I-M-O--,i-m-o--,1
91096,315,285,Homer Simpson: --K. Get it? ""I am OK."""
15038,"Ooh boy, casino night! Finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six."
15039,"Aw Marge, I bet you've gotten that out of your system."
15040,I'll put everything on lucky seventeen.
15041,Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
15042,Woo-hoo!
15043,I win!
15044,"This is it, baby. First thing tomorrow, we're getting a Playstation One!"
15045,I'd like to cash in these chips. Give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.
15046,But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!
15047,You think I won't manhandle a little boy?!
15048,Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!
15049,"Oh, what a delicious quiche! I drive a pink Miata."
15050,"La, la, la..."
15051,My name is Nelthon! I use a thalad fork. La-dee-dah! I wash my face!
15052,Clothesline.
15053,I wish I'd married a businessman. Then I'd have nice things.
15054,"Oh, I'm so confused."
15055,"On my chess set, the pawns are all Hamburglars."
15056,"Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. And when you do, people will remember you. Just look at these postage stamps."
15057,There's Bugs Bunny... Fat Elvis... Autumn in New England... Bats of the Southwest... all heroes. Wanna see Elvis kiss a bat? Hey baby come here lemme kiss you...
15058,"Squeak, squeak, squeak. No, don't kiss me."
15059,No way! I'm saving for a speedboat!
15060,I'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! You can't go to that school!
15061,"Why can't you have a normal dream, like being an Olympic figure skater?"
15062,Are you crazy? I'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!
15063,I'unno. How 'bout a horse whisperer?
15064,Over my dead body!
15065,One thousand dollars. Do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?
15066,"Marge, this is why people don't tell you things."
15067,"Well, we put up a flyer."
15068,You know the drill. Try to land on my back-fat.
15069,Can you describe the bill?
15070,IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...
15071,What?
15072,We've gone on plenty of great vacations.
15073,I still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
15074,"Well, I'd like to return to Brazil. But I hear the monkey problem is even worse now."
15075,"Marge, I'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. Now let's see, which rifle should I bring?"
15076,Would an American dollar encourage you to leave us alone?
15077,The place I was born is now a gator farm.
15078,Wow. I can't believe we met Mr. Bean.
15079,"Make with the tea, Jeeves."
15080,"We're bigshot tourists from everyone's favorite country: the USA. We saved your ass in Vietnam and shared our prostitutes with Hugh Grant. So give me some free maps, and none of that dry British wit."
15081,Thank you.
15082,"Aw Dad, I wish there was something I could do."
15083,Touch that mini bar and you're dead!
15084,"Fish? I don't know, I'm not really a vegetarian..."
15085,"Well, Marge, you've gotta admit. I've been on my best behavior this trip."
15086,That was over soccer results! Can you believe they gave Giggs a yellow card in the box?
15087,"I understand the word ""gave."" Unless it means something else in this country."
15088,"Now, now, let's just look... there's Big Ben, there's Piccadilly Circus, there's Jimmy Page, one of the greatest thieves of American black music who ever walked the earth. Bup, there's the kids."
15089,"You can't bet on my kids. This is America, pal!"
15090,What? What play?
15091,"You mean ""Macbeth""?"
15092,"What? By saying ""Macbeth""?"
15093,Saying what?
15094,"Mr. Macbeth, I'm really sorry."
15095,"But please, find it in your jewel-encrusted heart to forgive me."
15096,"Yes, this trip is entirely uneventful."
15097,I see an opening.
15098,That's it. I'm acting the way America acts best -- unilaterally.
15099,"Okay, I'm gonna go over there and see if they're cool."
15100,"Okay, let's see. Oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire..."
15101,"Lady, please. Get back in your overturned car. Let the guys handle this."
15102,Your Majesty?
15103,The Queen of whaaa?!
15104,Wait! We have to exchange insurance!
15105,Back cuts?
15106,"My Lord, we Americans love queens, be they homecoming or Dairy. This woman, however, is an imposter."
15107,"Her luggage is inscribed ""H.R.H."" -- which means her real name must be... Henrietta R. Hippo."
15108,"Your Honor, I've completely disappointed my wife. That's punishment enough. You understand these things, you're a grandmother."
15109,"Ohh, and a very manly one, if I may say so, m'lord."
15110,"Boy, she's good. If she were a hundred years younger... and I were a hundred years older..."
15111,America rules! Our Beatles are way better than your precious Rolling Stones!
15112,"Oh Marge, I Am so sorry. I should've listened to whatever it was you were saying."
15113,"Well Marge, if I die here, there's one thing I want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in England. They won't work in our VCR!"
15114,"Dear God of England: please let me go. In return I will spell the word ""color"" with a ""u"" and I'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, I can't do it. It's so stupid!"
15115,A secret tunnel? I don't know. Won't that get me in more trouble?
15116,"Okay, what do I do?"
15117,"Sweet freedom, here I--"
15118,"Boy, it's a good thing I'm leaving before I went nuts. Goodbye Sparkly Elves."
15119,"Boy, a Krispy Kreme would really clean up down here."
15120,"Hey, this place is amazing. It's fit for a Duke, or even an Earl..."
15121,"Please, your Majesty, I know that I, like many other Americans, have behaved like a total buffoon."
15122,"But we Americans are England's children. I know we don't call as often as we should, and we aren't as well-behaved as our goody two-shoes brother Canada, who by the way has never had a girlfriend, I'm just sayin'."
15123,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
15124,"See ya in Atlanta, jerk!"
15125,"Lady, you're gorgeous. You make Dame Edna look like a dude!"
15126,"Okay, Mother's Day gift check. Let's see what you got."
15127,Flow... yeah.
15128,"Bart, we made her the same thing!"
15129,"Kids, we're going Mother's Day shopping! I'm glad this holiday only comes every four years."
15130,"Let's see, what would she like?"
15131,Twenty on the trifecta?
15132,Her wedding china back?
15133,"I could get Marge a new window, just like this one."
15134,"Yeah, I love Sprawl-Mart. They've got everything. Even Christian videos with talking vegetables."
15135,"Mmm, Moses."
15136,How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?
15137,"Yeah, it's impressive. But I still haven't found the perfect gift for Marge. Only imperfect stuff for me."
15138,"Well, well, if it isn't Fatty and Smell-ma."
15139,"Wow! I never thought I'd say this, but you slags are all right."
15140,"Marge, you're gonna love my present. It is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap."
15141,"Whoa, Marge, get a room!"
15142,"Hmm, dare I pour caramel over the cotton candy?"
15143,This is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. Dig in!
15144,"That's it, kids. Suckle Daddy's sugar ball."
15145,That's my old lady.
15146,Ants!
15147,Birds!
15148,Cats!
15149,Flanderses!
15150,"Maybe you're right, Marge. Or maybe you're right, candy ball. No, Marge. Then again... No, Marge. Definitely Marge."
15151,"Goodbye, old friend. I'll think of you whenever I have a stroke or a heart attack."
15152,"Oh my God, I'm gonna be killed by a bear! Well, I guess I don't have to worry anymore about the dangers of smoking."
15153,Smooth.
15154,"Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it."
15155,"I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape."
15156,Choke on your candor!
15157,It's a deal!
15158,Hello? Anyone home?
15159,Marge? Maggie?
15160,"""The Bear Went Over The Mountain""?! ""The Berenstain Bears""?! Ahhh, Goldilocks... and the Three Bears!"
15161,"Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears..."
15162,Are you a Care Bear?
15163,Why does a bear need a crowbar?
15164,"No, go ahead."
15165,Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
15166,"You cowardly Swede! You face that bear like a man, or I'll never speak to you again."
15167,But how will I find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?
15168,"Finally, science has joined forces with revenge."
15169,Lookin' good. And I did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.
15170,"Check it out, ladies. The suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack."
15171,"I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit."
15172,"Rub a dub dub, I'm washin' the blub."
15173,What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things?
15174,"Lisa, the point of Moby Dick is ""be yourself."""
15175,Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
15176,"Marge, you awake? Marge?"
15177,"Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him."
15178,"No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name."
15179,"That is so cool. All right, you can come."
15180,I never realized how hot this suit is. I'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
15181,Suh-weet.
15182,Oh my God! Lenny! Carl! Bart?
15183,"I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man."
15184,Is this thing hurting you?
15185,"Okay, it's probably the tag. But just to be sure..."
15186,"Hey, you're not mean. It was just this tag that made you go ape-scat. We're not so different. Give me a hug."
15187,Jeez! I don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation.
15188,That's funny.
15189,"Oh no, the hunter has become the hunter!"
15190,He must be following this thing. Well I'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.
15191,"Wrong again, liberal media."
15192,"Don't worry, I'll find you someplace safe."
15193,"Okay, you wanna go over there."
15194,Hold on. Something doesn't feel right.
15195,Wait! Stop! I know bullets can be scary sometimes. But I have an idea. First we pull off all of your fur.
15196,"All right, all right I'm still thinking!"
15197,"They're looking for a male bear, right?"
15198,"It's so easy to condemn, so hard to create."
15199,What can I say? I love nature...
15200,Circle of life.
15201,BAH-DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH DAH-DAH...
15202,TIME TO WHIZ IN A FOAMING BOWL OF CHINA...
15203,A line for the bathroom? What gives?
15204,"Son, can I have cuts?"
15205,Sweet.
15206,Now calm down. I'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
15207,"Oh God, it's baby blood!"
15208,Bart! You're not hitting hard enough!
15209,The door? Now I'll never get to pee.
15210,"You just lost a box, pal!"
15211,"Yeah, well uh, funny thing about that..."
15212,"On our way to the clinic, I decided to give him a night his wang would never forget."
15213,Wanna play some air hockey?
15214,You're on!
15215,"I can't neuter you, boy. Not after all we've been through."
15216,"But from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!"
15217,You broke our deal -- we had an oral contract!
15218,I'm your man!
15219,"Welcome to the Homer Simpson Show. I'm your host, Next Card. Homer Simpson it's great to be here in Next Card. Springfield my guests are...Moe Szyslak, local businessman, Carl Carlson, raconteur, and Lenny Leonard, three-time juror. Gentlemen, what's on your minds?"
15220,Ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? Theaters... airplanes... why even here. Look!
15221,Who has more power? Miss America or Miss U.S.A.?
15222,"Why so formal, Lenny? You're my go-to guy."
15223,Interesting...
15224,"Please welcome new panelist, Barney Gumbel."
15225,"Please welcome my newest panelist, Disco Stu."
15226,My pleasure.
15227,"So did I, son. And look where I am today."
15228,"Boy, everybody loves my show."
15229,"Yes, you're right..."
15230,"Duck, Mr. Lincoln!"
15231,"Well, I took Bart's advice last week, so I guess it's Lisa's turn. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
15232,"You hit him high, I'll hit him low!"
15233,"Y'know, we've had a great time on this show ""riffing"" on small, unimportant subjects."
15234,"Well, that's all over now. From now on, we will focus solely on important issues."
15235,"Every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger. Yet, the IMF insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules."
15236,Why should America consume ninety percent of the world's resources? Argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!
15237,"You can't leave, I'm your ride home!"
15238,I'll audience you!
15239,"Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me."
15240,"Hey, where's my car?"
15241,Will you make my sundae for me?
15242,I'm hungry. Are they married yet?
15243,Then whose garter is this?
15244,I love the holiday season.
15245,"See you in spring, toes!"
15246,Oh my God! A DVD player.
15247,"Oh Carl, you remembered I like TV!"
15248,"Oh yes, I am... your present is right in the other room."
15249,"Come on machine, take my dollar!"
15250,"Fine, we'll play it your way."
15251,"Here you go, Lenny."
15252,"May the spirit of Retsin be with you all year long. God bless God, amen."
15253,Oh c'mon... Mr. Burns is way more selfish.
15254,That evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass Smithers...
15255,Joe DiMaggio?
15256,I need money for Christmas... can I get anything for this Joe DiMaggio baseball card? It's kinda old.
15257,Thank you! Freak.
15258,"Hey, everybody! We're going shopping at the Springfield Heights Promenade!"
15259,"First we'll buy gifts for each other. Then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a Christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding."
15260,"Doing pretty good so far. A key ring for Marge, key ring for Bart..."
15261,That thing for me.
15262,"Oh God, it's so unnecessary!"
15263,I'm upside down so much!
15264,"Oh, if I buy this, I won't have anything left for a Christmas tree..."
15265,That's the birthday I'm always forgetting. I must have it!
15266,"Uh, sure, you know it. The biggest tree from the finest lot in town!"
15267,"It's fine. Everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio."
15268,Exactly.
15269,"Gorgeous, huh? And quite the bargain."
15270,"Oh, it just needs a little love."
15271,Why do the things I love always burn?
15272,Isn't it sufficient.
15273,Uh... Woo hoo! Maggie's talking!
15274,"There's a trickle-down theory here. If I'm happy, I'm less abusive to the rest of you."
15275,"Oh, this is sadder than ""Tuesdays With Morrie."""
15276,"C'mon Marge, I'm not the only selfish person. You have to get your hair done at ""Supercuts."" I guess regular ""Cuts"" just isn't good enough for you."
15277,That's not true. I cared what you thought once you found out.
15278,Can't you yell at me now and get it over with?
15279,"I don't need her, I've got you, Astrolabe."
15280,Jimmy Stewart as a puppet is just wrong.
15281,"Mr. McGrew! I love that blind, senile old man."
15282,I heard you the first five times.
15283,Oh McGrew. Once again you've mistaken something for something!
15284,Oh my God! It's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.
15285,"C'mon, Death. Leave McGrew alone. Take Tiny Tim."
15286,Unloved by Al? Noooooooo!
15287,Unloved by all! Noooooooo!
15288,"Children, children, what day is this?"
15289,Thank God! There's still four more days 'til Christmas. I have time to reform my ways!
15290,I just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. It was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at Christmas. And get this: he learns a lesson!
15291,"Marge, TV and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. From now on, I will stop being selfish and start being good. In fact, I'll be the nicest man in town."
15292,"Yes, but this time I'm sober. Ish."
15293,"No need, Flanders. I've already given them my old clothes."
15294,Good-lookin' group.
15295,You're welcome!
15296,"Look, Lenny. I know I was a pretty bad Secret Santa, so I wanted to make it up to you."
15297,"And I filed down all the sharp corners. See, your eye is completely safe."
15298,"Marge, do you want this last pork chop?"
15299,"All right, now you're startin' to creep me out."
15300,I'm not looking for glory or wealth. I'm just buying that stairway to heaven Jesus sang of.
15301,"Get back to your bong, hippie."
15302,Just like the Pope!
15303,"Being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner."
15304,And here's another act of Christian charity I pulled out of my butt.
15305,I built a skating rink for the whole town!
15306,"Here's your skates. Oh, you'll have to take off those boots."
15307,Ewww.
15308,Pathetic Flanders. Thinking he can buy people's love with thoughtful gifts.
15309,I'll show Flanders. I'm gonna get everyone a car. What's that one good American car?
15310,Uh... is it despair?
15311,Hmm. You've given me a lot to think about.
15312,"I've got it... when everyone's asleep, I'll take away their presents. Then they'll be happy! Thanks, Buddha."
15313,"YOU'RE A HERO, HOMER J. / YOU'RE AS CRAFTY AS A SKUNK / THEY'LL THANK YOU IN THE MORNING FOR STEALING FLANDERS' JUNK / HOMER JAAAAAY! / You're a double-bacon genius-burger... AND JUST A LITTLE DRUNK."
15314,Now to hear the joyous sound of people waking up on Christmas to discover they have no presents.
15315,"They don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude."
15316,"Um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?"
15317,"Wait a minute, everyone! There's your Christmas up there!"
15318,"Let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. But we're probably right. Amen."
15319,"And now, I think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! Ned?"
15320,"Look, Maggie! Funny Daddy!"
15321,Too hard.
15322,"Give Daddy the remote, Maggie. Give daddy the..."
15323,"Oh. Wise guy, eh?"
15324,Nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh.
15325,"Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!"
15326,You can't change the rules in the middle of the game! We never would have had these kids if we'd thought we had to pay for 'em. Promises were made!
15327,Then why did you appear in it?
15328,Maybe she was you and you're not! How many kids do we have?
15329,"Wrong, lady! Oh wait, the baby."
15330,"Honey, this marriage is a partnership. When you fall, I pick you up. And when you can't finish a sandwich, I eat that sandwich."
15331,And I promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.
15332,"Honey, no one messes with my Mrs. I'll come down on those guys like the garage door on Bart's bike."
15333,"You just leave everything to Homer. And now, I believe you owe me half a sandwich."
15334,"Here comes my commercial. In six, five, four..."
15335,You've probably heard a lot of bad things about Families Come First.
15336,"But newspaper writers are a bunch of jerks. Who really opposes ""Families Come First?"""
15337,"Many childless advocates are like Ben Affleck -- famous, successful people from out of State!"
15338,They live in fancy houses in other places.
15339,"""Families Come First"" is supported by lifelong Springfieldians you know and trust like me, Milhouse's Dad, Bumblebee Man, Surly Duff, and that jerk that goes ""Yeees!"""
15340,"For more information, visit our website, www.al-jazeera.com. We're not affiliated. We're just piggybacking on their message board."
15341,I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you. I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you.
15342,Either way. The important thing is the system works.
15343,Great. Let's dump these kids in an R-rated movie while we go someplace nice.
15344,"Marge, wait."
15345,I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am Rudy Giuliani. You must forgive Homer. I am.
15346,What do I care?
15347,"Bart, that creepy kid's here!"
15348,A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say?
15349,I'm confused! Which is it?
15350,"Yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works."
15351,That's right. No questions asked.
15352,"There, there. You're both right."
15353,"Son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?"
15354,"For true, son."
15355,Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
15356,I'll assemble it myself.
15357,I can make a bike. I made you.
15358,"Hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day."
15359,"Oh man, this is so confusing."
15360,What the Hell is this?
15361,Bike's over there.
15362,Son are you okay? I brought my home-made first aid kit. It's spring-loaded for quick access!
15363,"First of all, thank you. Secondly..."
15364,"There's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""Dad I don't think you can build a fully-functional robot."""
15365,"Robot, I command you: do something cool!"
15366,I could quit now... but then my son will never look up to me. Why was I born a Dad?
15367,Why... do... I... suck?
15368,Wait a minute. What is it my Dad always said to me?
15369,That's it!
15370,"Oh, the beer's gone. I'll have to suck it out of the shag."
15371,Like a dog. Or a snowman!
15372,"""...I'd love to be with you, but I just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. Will meet you later. Love, Dad."
15373,Doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...
15374,"Woo hoo! I mean, beep beep!"
15375,Pretended.
15376,Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother.
15377,"I like you, son."
15378,"Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now."
15379,"Well, I've been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank."
15380,"I don't think so, son. But on the other hand, I may be closer than you think."
15381,So much metal in my eye.
15382,Oh no! My recurring nightmare is coming true!
15383,"There are many people I'd like to thank for this award. My wife, Anjelica Huston -- this is for you, Angie! We did it!"
15384,"Listen son, there's something I have to tell you about our robot."
15385,Uh...
15386,I just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
15387,"And if anything happens to me, I want you bullies to take care of my boy."
15388,I wish I had bullies like you growing up.
15389,"You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm!"
15390,"That's what we in the business call ""a biggie."""
15391,The business of being a Dad. Can you hand me that magnet?
15392,Can you do my back?
15393,"Bart, I'm sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. I'm a fraud."
15394,Affirmative.
15395,You really think so?
15396,And I'm the luckiest--
15397,"Hey, what gives? He's not killing me!"
15398,He knows just how I like my martinis... full of alcohol.
15399,"Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside."
15400,Keep me focused.
15401,"Son, did you ever suspect it was me?"
15402,"Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable."
15403,"Let's see... I'll have sixteen gravy scrape 'ems, a bucket of twisty lard, and two super-choker breakfast burritos with macho sauce. And mega-size it, please."
15404,Great. And I'll have a diet coke. Deep fried.
15405,Hmm... need more lap.
15406,I can't see! I'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!
15407,Why don't I just pull over?
15408,It's stuck! Krusty collectible toy jammed under brake pedal!
15409,Oh no! I hit the grief counselor!
15410,I had a car!
15411,I gotta get a job before Marge finds out I was fired.
15412,That's it! I'll steal this sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!
15413,We'll clean out those stupid Americans.
15414,"...you probably want to talk this over, so I'll leave you two ""alone."" Excuse me."
15415,They'll be back.
15416,He was my best friend.
15417,"Cool, an ambulance from the '60s! I bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. Injured hippies!"
15418,I'll do it!
15419,Guess what? I quit my job as a used car salesman.
15420,"Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver!"
15421,Maybe on planet ZooZoo.
15422,"Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys. They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake."
15423,I'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.
15424,"Slow down, Picasso! You were gonna start a novel without informing me?"
15425,I also fed some ducklings.
15426,"Fine, fine. I'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment."
15427,Whatever. But I think you look great already.
15428,"Where to, Mack?"
15429,"Hospital, eh? Wow, everyone's goin' there tonight."
15430,Why don't you admit I know it's around here somewhere?
15431,"Marge, I'm back!"
15432,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner, stat! And the kids need some CPR lessons."
15433,I'll say.
15434,"Oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. I'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice."
15435,Marge! We're out of bath towels.
15436,"Ooh, ice cream truck!"
15437,HERE IN MY CAR / I AM HOSING OFF BLOOD / SOME OF IT'S MINE / BUT MOST OF IT'S NOT / HERE'S MARGE...
15438,"Ooh, typed!"
15439,No problem.
15440,Two hundred and eighty-six pages!
15441,Woo hoo! I'm half-way through!
15442,"All right, ""Chapter One."" Hm, that makes sense. ""There once was a girl from Nantucket..."" Good, good... ""Her name was Temperance Barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. She..."""
15443,"No! Gotta read Marge's book. Can't get distracted. Hm... ""distracted,"" that's a funny word. Does anyone ever get ""tracted?"" Let me call the suicide hotline and ask them."
15444,Well what?
15445,"Oh, yes."
15446,I did.
15447,No! They were all in their own way totally awesome.
15448,"As I've always said: ""publish or perish""!"
15449,"So, how much bleach did you drink? Not a talker, eh?"
15450,"Apu, do you sell Crazy Straws? I've got a guy with a broken back and I'm tryin' to cheer him up."
15451,What are you talking about?
15452,Why do you keep talking that way?!
15453,"Well, then maybe I will."
15454,That one I got.
15455,"I'll have to read Marge's book. And I swore never to read again after ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. It did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?"
15456,The Harpooned Heart. Book on tape! As read by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
15457,How can you write such horrible things about me?
15458,I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.
15459,Just tell me how much of this is true!
15460,I knew it! And what about the romance between you and Cyrus?
15461,"Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again."
15462,Flanders!
15463,Open this door right now!
15464,What are you doing here?
15465,"Flanders, pull over! I'm an ambulance!"
15466,"Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago."
15467,Would you help me be a better husband?
15468,In Marge's book I was so mean and you were so nice. How can I be more like you? Just give me some advice.
15469,Uh-huh.
15470,"Why would I rub her back unless I wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good."
15471,"That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
15472,"Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own."
15473,"Marge, I've got it all figured out: Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to steal the Jack Ruby."
15474,"All right, we're back to square one. Put on some coffee."
15475,I was so close.
15476,"All I know is the guy who played Mozart was also in ""Animal House."" Now there's a movie with good music. ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... / NOBODY EVER WENT TO CLASS... / THEN WE SAW DONALD SUTHERLAND'S ASS... / ANIMAL HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE... /"
15477,"ROLLIN', ROLLIN', ROLLIN' / TOXIC BARREL ROLLIN'"
15478,"To old man Burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing!"
15479,A lot of that went in my lungs.
15480,"That's great. I'm honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina."
15481,"You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up."
15482,These charity address labels that came in the mail.
15483,I don't wanna go home! I'm not done talking to me!
15484,Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.
15485,Five bucks? I don't need your sharity! I'll dance for my money!
15486,"I am so wasted. Oh my God, oh my God, we're having a simultaneous pass out!"
15487,Loveless loners are so lucky. There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.
15488,Hm...
15489,"Hey, I know you. We met in a police lineup."
15490,"You don't have to tell me, I was number three. Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?"
15491,"Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people!"
15492,"Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you..."
15493,All the answers you need are in here. Happy anniversary!
15494,Nope.
15495,Nope.
15496,Nope.
15497,"Close, but no cigar. Just plain diamonds."
15498,"I heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor."
15499,"Yeah, you heard your mother."
15500,MR. BO-JANGLES / MR. BO-JANGLES / WE'RE ALL BO-JANGLES / WHO KILLED BO-JANGLES? / MAYBE IT WAS YOU...
15501,"Thank you. Thank you. Remember, my dog up and died. Thank you."
15502,I want to get a second house. Closer to work.
15503,"But Marge, it was all for you. To buy you all the nice things you deserve. The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice..."
15504,I don't understand.
15505,"Hoo boy, are you in trouble."
15506,"When a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off."
15507,Wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.
15508,"Where's the ""ee-yow?"""
15509,You didn't sit on the toilet!
15510,"Butt on bowl, little man!"
15511,It doesn't matter!
15512,Ee-yow!
15513,Why you little...!
15514,"Joke's on me, is it...?"
15515,It's old lady Simpson! Run!
15516,Uhh... I'll tell you what's goin' on...
15517,...I'm taking you all out for pancakes!
15518,Yeah!
15519,"Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish."
15520,"Hey, Apu, what's with the line?"
15521,Pre-nursery school?!
15522,Are you saying my daughter can't cut it? Just because I owe you fourteen thousand dollars? I'll show you!
15523,"C'mon, Maggie. You're getting into that school!"
15524,Which one? Tri-City? Omni-Pay? Insta-Threat? I've beaten 'em all!
15525,"I'm sorry we wasted your time, your Lordship."
15526,"Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer..."
15527,"...Who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? Geez."
15528,I'm taking you all out for tacos!
15529,Woo-hoo! I got that one right too!
15530,"Go, Seminoles!"
15531,"So our kids keep getting smarter! If we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids."
15532,"If you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. I'm slappin' this sucker right over ""Support Our Troops."""
15533,"Your mother's right, honey. Katie Couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!"
15534,That still sounds like the smart kid.
15535,The school sent this dealy over for Maggie. His name is Phonic Frog.
15536,That's me. Huh-oh-muh-eh-er!
15537,I'll be right back.
15538,"Why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? Why, Santa, why?"
15539,"Oh, I knew it!"
15540,"Oh no, the giant is waking up!"
15541,Hit the red button!
15542,"I know, we'll use reverse psychology. Maggie, don't press the red button!"
15543,Damn it!
15544,"Marge, I've always loved you. Bart, you were a worthy foe."
15545,"Oh good, she's here in time to see us die!"
15546,"Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere."
15547,"Well, I think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. Namely, food."
15548,How'd you get in here?
15549,Zing.
15550,"That's my baby, jerk."
15551,The Wild Dingleberries?
15552,I am so there!
15553,"How 'bout ""Diet Coke -- the Movie?""... ""President Air Bud: Tail To The Chief?""... ""My Big Fat Greek Salad?"""
15554,"Ooh, well, I am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. And the wager only sweetens the deal."
15555,What Would Jesus View?
15556,"Okay kids, forget the movie. We'll just go to the furniture store and sit down."
15557,The Re-deadening? Is that any good?
15558,"Hey Lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?"
15559,"Don't ruin it for me! One adult and four children for ""The Re-deadening."""
15560,"Hey, I paid for this popcorn and I'm eating it."
15561,"Relax, stupid. Everything you see is make believe. Although it is based on a true story. Some of which happened in this very theater."
15562,"Oh honey, don't be scared. Look, they killed the evil doll."
15563,"Well, what do you know? It's unkillable."
15564,"Honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?"
15565,That's my girl.
15566,But scaring kids is good for them. It hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.
15567,Sorry. I forgot I bought the soundtrack album.
15568,"Who loves ya, baby?"
15569,Okay. You have the right to remain sexy. Anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. If you cannot afford a sex-torney--
15570,"I don't see any ghost. I did find this Newsweek from 1986: ""Why America Loves Saddam Hussein."""
15571,"That's it. It's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin."
15572,I thought we killed him!
15573,But I did delete him from my bulk email list.
15574,Oh yeah. That monkey got America through some tough times.
15575,No way! He's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
15576,"Okay kids, you can keep him."
15577,"C'mon, little fella. You're hangin' with me tonight."
15578,"Guys, I'd like you to meet Artie Ziff."
15579,I'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.
15580,And the peanuts in your mouth.
15581,All of them.
15582,Four jacks.
15583,Check it out! I own a multi-national corporation. I always knew some day I'd be a C.O.D.
15584,Investor confidence? Perhaps this affects me -- I own two hundred and thirty million shares of ZiffCorp stock.
15585,I sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.
15586,Don't tell my kids I'm going to jail! Tell them I've joined the Blue Man Group! I'm the fat one!
15587,Plead the fifth amend-what?
15588,Refuse to answer on the grounds that I what?
15589,"Inseminate myself? Dudes, I think this guy's comin' on to me."
15590,"Your majesty, can I go home now?"
15591,"I miss you guys so much. The smell of Marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my ""owies"" when I go boom... This place has become like a prison to me!"
15592,"Aw, it's no use, son. By the time I get out of here you'll be grown. TURN AROUND / TURN AROUND / TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN / AND YOU'RE TOO BIG TO CHOKE."
15593,Can I apply my time toward a future crime?
15594,"Oh my God! Maggie, you're talking!"
15595,"Oh Bart, what a man you've become."
15596,I don't think we've seen the last of Artie Ziff.
15597,"Man, even I think movie popcorn has gotten too big."
15598,"Get your own, mooch."
15599,"Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet."
15600,"Hey, my car insurance expired. Quite a while ago."
15601,"That's it. From now on I'm not looking forward to anything. Oh my God, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! I can't wait!"
15602,That was you!?
15603,"Marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!"
15604,And I know just where to find him. 742 Evergreen Terrace.
15605,He's in the house?
15606,And it's a perfect time... I just got fired again.
15607,"Marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? I mean, who am I gonna complain about while I'm drinking?"
15608,"Well yeah, legally. But if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?"
15609,"Hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. But you'll have to catch me first!"
15610,"Ow, my ankles snapped."
15611,"Ahh, summer in Tuscany."
15612,"Pleasant aroma, rich full body, well-aged... and the wine's not bad either."
15613,I drank this much!
15614,Ooh! Can I have my special cup?
15615,"Oh honey, I love to hear you laugh."
15616,Yes you do.
15617,"Hey, you do a great me, Marge. You gotta show the guys at Moe's."
15618,"Come on, we'll have a blast. Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge. Go to bed when it says."
15619,"Two glasses of wine, Moe."
15620,"All good points. Sleep tight, my drunken angel."
15621,Yep. Your mother and I have become a legendary party couple. Like Scott and Zelda Munster!
15622,"Sorry, Marge -- I gotta break in my ski boots some time."
15623,No problem. We can still have fun without you drinking.
15624,"You got it. And when I feel weak, I will draw strength from the Bible."
15625,Uh-oh. Here comes the gospel according to puke.
15626,"Don't worry, honey. I don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing."
15627,"Ahh, the Germans. You just can't stay mad at 'em."
15628,You can just nurse it.
15629,Nurse it! Nurse it!
15630,"Yes, and you've said that several times now."
15631,I'm in no condition to drive. Wait -- I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk.
15632,"Okay, okay. Remember the rules for drinking and driving. Drive slow but not too slow. Drink some cola to keep yourself alert."
15633,What the?
15634,"Nice work, cruise control."
15635,"In a minute, honey."
15636,"Oh my God! If I get one more D.U.I., they'll take away my license. And what will I leave when I rent rollerblades?"
15637,"Aw, this is a new low for me."
15638,"I paid your bail, honey. You're free to go."
15639,"But you do believe it, right?"
15640,That's my girl!
15641,She's not coming anymore.
15642,"Listen, Moe. I did something really terrible to someone I love."
15643,"Well, what I did was..."
15644,Can I have some peanuts?
15645,"I can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? Sir, she is not an alcoholic! You can't put me on hold! I'll put you on hold!"
15646,I AM A LINEMAN FOR THE COUNTY Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold. AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD There are... eight... calls ahead of you. AND THE WICHITA LINEMAN IS STILL ON THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LINE!
15647,"Lisa, Lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. MacARTHUR PARK IS MELTING IN THE DARK / ALL THAT SWEET GREEN ICING ROLLING DOWN / SOMEONE LEFT MY CAKE OUT IN THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI- LI... LI... LI... LI..."
15648,"Flanders, can you watch my kids while I'm at the rehab clinic?"
15649,My demons and I are closer than ever. Next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. I'm just goin' in to bust Marge out.
15650,Feed my pets and tape my shows!
15651,I'm here to deliver a package to Marge Simpson.
15652,Dammit!
15653,Marge!
15654,"I have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. I put you behind the wheel and I'm so, so, so sorry."
15655,"Marge, I did it out of love. Love of not being arrested. But I realize now that nothing is more important than you."
15656,That woman means the world to me. Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?
15657,"No wonder they call it ""the good book."""
15658,"Aw, shut up, Captain Bringdown."
15659,"Okay, Marge. For you I'll give up rum-based cocktails. Except mojitos and rum and coke."
15660,"All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors."
15661,"Hey, I only drink that when I'm already drunk."
15662,"Hey, anything's possible. With a little help from my Bible."
15663,"Oh no! It's a real one! Noooooo! Why God, why?"
15664,Where are your clothes for the gentleman who's big and fat?
15665,Woo hoo!
15666,So many shoppers. Ow! Damn this... ow! Resilient economy.
15667,Dressing room? Uh oh.
15668,Is it Lenny?
15669,"It's not all your fault. All these years, I watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet I did nothing. So in a way, I too am a victim... of you."
15670,"Oh, I get it. Blame the strangler."
15671,My poor boy is miserable in here. There has to be something I can do to help him.
15672,"Interesting. Marge, what does that sign say?"
15673,I believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
15674,Uh-huh. When does training start?
15675,Put that sissy down!
15676,"If you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?"
15677,That's right. I got a job here so I can watch over you like a mother hen.
15678,"I sure am. Here you go, son. I brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge."
15679,"Well, that's the end of my shift."
15680,"See you Monday. Oh wait, Monday's Martin Luther King Day. I'll see ya when I see ya."
15681,Love you.
15682,You just don't understand boys. He's stupid.
15683,"Relax, what's the worst that could happen?"
15684,No son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.
15685,Let's go.
15686,"Son, I want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive."
15687,"Gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of Christmas."
15688,"I'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. We're all out of triple A's, so I'm gonna whittle down a couple of these D's."
15689,She sure loves that couch.
15690,"Come on, it's your last night of freedom. You gotta have some fun."
15691,"Hey, take it easy on Skinner. He's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong."
15692,"What are you trying to tell me, Skinner?"
15693,Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
15694,"Marge, guess what! Skinner wants to bail on his wedding!"
15695,"Oh man, is this awkward. I'm outta here."
15696,"Yeah Marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. Oh uh, by the way... can I borrow your car tomorrow? Mine's acting up."
15697,"Hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage."
15698,"Whatever. The important thing is to get Skinner to that altar. Because once a union has been sanctified by God, it takes at least six months to tear it apart."
15699,"Right, naked Duffman?"
15700,"Don't worry, I've got a man on the perimeter."
15701,This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.
15702,"Okay, Fat Load here."
15703,Hey champ. Ready to take the plunge?
15704,"Yeah, he's crazy all right."
15705,Unkink the hose!
15706,Wait a minute. I thought you didn't wanna get married.
15707,"Don't worry, Principal Skinner."
15708,"Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there's one thing I know, it's how to win back a furious woman. We'll go to her house, and I'll whisper to you exactly what to say."
15709,"Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won't have to."
15710,"Okay, just repeat after me. ""Edna, I made a huge mistake and I want you back."""
15711,Marge? Are you helping her?
15712,Which are you saying is dead? Our marriage or our batteries?
15713,Shut up! I didn't tell you to say that!
15714,Because I'm successfully married.
15715,Uh-oh.
15716,"Why did I take it off? Oh, right. To see if I could skip it across Lake Michigan."
15717,"String quartet, are you tuned up?"
15718,And the castrati?
15719,And a one and a two and a...
15720,Give her back to Skinner! A fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!
15721,"Okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my Lois Lane comics, buy some Jimmy Olsens, and stop Edna from making a terrible mistake!"
15722,"Don't worry, Marge. We'll get something to eat."
15723,I don't see Skinner anywhere.
15724,That room has a dry erase board. They could be doing anything in there! Anything.
15725,"Okay Marge, I hear ya. Now that Krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems."
15726,"Marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and I became one."
15727,Would you marry me again?
15728,"And now, Padre, if you would do the honors."
15729,"Marge, you just agreed to raise the kids Klingon!"
15730,"Okay, don't go. Just stay here and rot with Grampa."
15731,I'll right-side you!
15732,I say you don't exist!
15733,Can I have both?
15734,"Son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain ""payoffs."""
15735,Exactly.
15736,WHERE DO I BEGIN? TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW GREAT A LOVE CAN BE...
15737,THE SIMPLE SOMETHING THAT DUM DEEDLE DUM DEE DEE... / NOW LET'S PUSH PLAAAY!
15738,"Yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the Hell up!"
15739,"Eh, well, I wouldn't be happy."
15740,"So, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?"
15741,We're alone now.
15742,Why you little...
15743,"What kind of an airline routes all their flights through Nome, Alaska?"
15744,Here's your future!
15745,Remember our honeymoon?
15746,"Marge, let's do it."
15747,We get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? As the Bible says: screw that!
15748,"We don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane."
15749,There's a first class?
15750,"And look at me, I'm reading ""The Economist."" Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?"
15751,It is.
15752,"Boy, it's great being here without those children of yours."
15753,"And tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump."
15754,You keep thinking that!
15755,COME ON EVERYBODY HAVE SOME SEX-UAL CONGRESS / NOT THE KIND OF CONGRESS THAT CONTAINED PAUL TSONGAS...
15756,"Marge, I won't let that happen. We have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. Not 'til Lisa's in college and we've lost contact with Bart."
15757,I've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!
15758,Noooo!
15759,"Oh yeah, like people in New Jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. It's on the freakin' state flag."
15760,Occupied!
15761,"At last, we're alone..."
15762,"Oh, right."
15763,"And now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. But before the intercourse, the dinner course."
15764,"All I wanted was a second honeymoon, and now the floor is made of lava."
15765,"I knew if we got up early enough, we could sneak away from Bart and Lisa. Kids don't beat me, I beat kids."
15766,You monsters! You followed us!
15767,Never!
15768,This way!
15769,Quick -- we can hide in here!
15770,"Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now, c'mon!"
15771,This must be what it's like to be in space.
15772,"And yet, I've never been to me."
15773,That sliding should stop soon.
15774,This rolling is just temporary.
15775,"Ah, that's better. So why do they call this place Niagara Falls anyway?"
15776,"Marge, I guess we'll just have to make love in Heaven. I'll bet it always works up there."
15777,"Oh, you're on my hair. Oh, that's better."
15778,No one does that to my daughter!
15779,"Quiet, the commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV."
15780,Do I ever!
15781,Would I!
15782,I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
15783,Nope. Just lookin' for that golden ticket.
15784,"Nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! At long last."
15785,Huh?
15786,Judge a pig competition?... But I'm no super-genius! Or are I?
15787,"Hey, I know that country!"
15788,USA! USA!
15789,Comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job...
15790,"Ugh, too eighties."
15791,But I've gotta do something! I'll need a disguise.
15792,Hold it right there!
15793,You've hurt your last feeling!
15794,"Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!"
15795,"Whatcha doin', sweetie?"
15796,"That's really sweet, honey."
15797,"Aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down."
15798,"What's wrong, son?"
15799,"Somebody ought to take him down a peg. Or, should I say, down a pie."
15800,"Maybe you're right, Lisa. Maybe you're pie. Pie-be you're pie."
15801,Comic Book Guy! Don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
15802,"Oh, I think you'd find his filling extremely hot."
15803,Flanders!? He's not man enough to trim my crust. I mean Pie Man's crust. I'm not Pie Man.
15804,This is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
15805,"Not so fast, old-time liberal."
15806,"No trap can hold Homer Simpson! But I'm not Homer Simpson. I'm the Pie Man. Homer Simpson away! I mean, the Pie Man!"
15807,Dammit!
15808,"Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet."
15809,"Pie Man is not your father, little girl. I... murdered your father."
15810,We shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
15811,"Watch it, one more step. Welcome to my secret lair."
15812,"So it would seem. Anyhoo, I'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? Mild-mannered Homer Simpson..."
15813,Honorable men can differ. Now what brings you down here?
15814,"All right, I'll stop. But what'll I do with these pies?"
15815,"I was in so deep, I forgot pies were food."
15816,I'll show him.
15817,"No, I shouldn't."
15818,Or should I?
15819,"I'll keep my promise, honey."
15820,Since when do I listen to cakes?
15821,You're all so wise... I wish I could eat each and every one of you.
15822,I've run out of pie-related puns!
15823,"It's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!"
15824,I already work for you.
15825,Do I get two paychecks?
15826,But I promised my daughter--
15827,Nooo! Not community service -- I can't stand helping others! I just can't!
15828,"No, not him! Anyone but him! I've had my problems with him. Everyone has. But like every monster, he just wants to be loved."
15829,I can't sleep. I keep thinking about the Pie Man.
15830,"What if he started pieing good people? Not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?"
15831,"No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it."
15832,See...
15833,You know I'm not Pie Man.
15834,"Oh come on, she's a little girl."
15835,Sorry.
15836,The Dalai Lama!
15837,I can't do this in front of Lisa. Why does she have to believe in things?
15838,"Please forgive me, talking llama."
15839,No. I won't. There's only one way I can escape from this nightmare.
15840,"I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!"
15841,"Yeah. Let's go home, honey."
15842,Was it the kiss?
15843,"Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!"
15844,Homer drunk... but how? Hmmm...
15845,"Eww! I kissed that sad, weird kid!"
15846,My beer! You never had a chance to become my urine! Why you little...
15847,"Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?"
15848,Permission to treat this witness as hostile.
15849,"Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you."
15850,"It was years ago, when I was ten. Back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s..."
15851,Underprivileged? You pretended we were poor just to get me into camp?
15852,"Wow, a Negro!"
15853,So cool.
15854,I can't wait to meet the girls!
15855,I thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.
15856,I got it!
15857,"Ooo la la, a girl with teeth. Me like!"
15858,That's 'cause I've eaten sixteen pieces of pie.
15859,"You know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp."
15860,Because I talked to you.
15861,I couldn't see her through the flaps. But she's my kinda girl...
15862,"To me they were the rubbery gates of heaven, because behind them was the girl of my dreams."
15863,"Well, I can ask if she has any friends, 'cause she wants to meet me tonight."
15864,"Ooh, a switchblade. I see the switch, but where's the blade?"
15865,Found it.
15866,An eye patch? But I've got a date tonight!
15867,"All right, how should I get there?"
15868,"Hm, I guess it's row versus wade. And it's my right to choose."
15869,Who are you?
15870,I couldn't believe my eye.
15871,"She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. Uh... until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage."
15872,"Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess."
15873,Whee! Recess!
15874,Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? That's still one more than you.
15875,I'm so lame!
15876,"Well, that stinks. But I still get to kiss you, right?"
15877,I got it!
15878,"Think, Homer, think."
15879,I'm Elvis. Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.
15880,Hi.
15881,"Elvis? What the Hell kind of name is... oh yeah, right."
15882,There goes a good friend.
15883,"Oh man, I want to kiss her. Wait -- I just thought of the greatest move ever!"
15884,How am I supposed to kiss those things? Interrupt her with something witty!
15885,Uhhhh... Ummmm...
15886,"Kiss her already. What, are you chicken? Bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok!"
15887,It was pretty delicious.
15888,It felt like a cluster bomb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies.
15889,Whuh-oh.
15890,Absolutely. Or my name isn't... whatever I told you it was.
15891,"She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up..."
15892,We had just finished our first smooch. And I felt a feeling I'd never felt before:
15893,I found this stone earlier. I was gonna use it as a nerd-smasher... but I want you to have it.
15894,"Hey, you're right. Give it back! No, I still want you to have it. But every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me."
15895,"What a kiss. If I died now, I'd die happy."
15896,"...ooh, what a view..."
15897,"Good ol' patch, you saved my life!"
15898,What the? Fat camp?
15899,I don't belong here!
15900,Kids love trains.
15901,"I've gotta go, I've got a date!"
15902,Somewhere out there she's waiting for me.
15903,Now's my chance.
15904,Love... conquers... all.
15905,Snake!
15906,"Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?"
15907,She wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
15908,No.
15909,I just blew my first chance at true love.
15910,"And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me."
15911,"Earth to special girl? You forgive me, right?"
15912,What about now?
15913,What about now?
15914,What about now?
15915,What about now?
15916,"Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you. But I've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun I hid from you, the time I sued the church, ruining Lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?"
15917,That's not true! I thought about that girl every day of my life... until I met you.
15918,All right. This is my memory box. I haven't opened it in thirty years.
15919,"Ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. Someday I'll write you back, Osama. Ah, here's what I'm lookin' for."
15920,I sure did. I kept it right next to my IBM stock... king.
15921,Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all?
15922,"Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge."
15923,Here you go.
15924,Don't forget Maggie!
15925,Doctor! Perform a diagnosis!
15926,Cool!
15927,"Bart, pass the ketchup. Bart, pass the ketchup!"
15928,"Oh, sorry, right."
15929,"Bart, pass the corn. Bart, pass the corn!"
15930,Everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.
15931,To date!
15932,No one calls me unpatriotic.
15933,Uh-oh.
15934,"Hey, guys."
15935,"Oh, cold shoulder, huh? Well, I'll just talk to myself. Hey, how ya doin', Homer? Oh, not too bad, how about you? Oh I'm fine. Your wife was great in bed last night. You keep your hands off my wife! Oh yeah? Well I give her what she needs. And she likes..."
15936,"Oh, Homer, stop it!"
15937,Even my best friends have left me! I'm all alone!
15938,Y'ello. Appear on your TV show?! Tell our side of the story?! You'll see us there?! Goodbye?! Dial tone?!
15939,"No, no, no, let her finish."
15940,"Son, I've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. Don't rock the boat. Don't even get in the boat."
15941,"Just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. But don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy."
15942,"Talk about boats! Then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't."
15943,"There there, save your lies for the American public."
15944,What'd you say?
15945,BUY ME SOME PEANUTS AND CRACKERJACK... / I DON'T CARE IF... OW!
15946,Do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?
15947,Bill Clinton? What are you doin' here?
15948,"Yeah, yeah. Next commercial."
15949,Who are you?
15950,I don't want to be in any stupid talent show. Not without my Tennessee walking horses.
15951,"Now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. But you can't spell U.S.A. without us... eh?"
15952,FIFTY STARS AND THIRTEEN STRIPES...
15953,TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY IS NO CHORE...
15954,"We mean it, don't move."
15955,"OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES..."
15956,"Because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. And this time I want it tight!"
15957,What genius put a prison on the middle of an island?
15958,Yes.
15959,"Great, dive in."
15960,I'm not made of money! We'll swim to Oakland.
15961,"Oh, what's the use? Even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate America. I don't want to end up like Elmo, hanging himself in prison."
15962,And here no one calls me a fat jerk... I'm a gourmand!
15963,"No, Marge, there's one group that's always welcome in America: immigrants without I.D."
15964,"Well, kids, this is the first chapter of our brand new lives... in America."
15965,Simpson.
15966,"Ooh, that'll save some time."
15967,"Now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. I'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop."
15968,Bart! You promised you'd stop making that comparison.
15969,Per... our... agreement!
15970,"If that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. We'll lose tourists! And then who will buy my roadside corn?"
15971,"There's a lot you don't know about me, Marge. A lot that would shock you."
15972,Now to do something I've never done before -- help out an old man.
15973,"Here's a poem: ""run fast, or lose your ass""!"
15974,"Bart, you're grounded for a year."
15975,"Okay, three bucks."
15976,Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!
15977,"I'm always happy to help you, sweetie."
15978,He TOSSES a paper and yells out the window.
15979,Extree! Extree! Man driving erratically throws papers out window!
15980,"Boy, I can't wait to dance on his grave."
15981,Stupid women drivers.
15982,Stupid women helicopter pilots.
15983,Everyone okay?
15984,These batteries have to power everything in our house!
15985,"YO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT, WHAT I REALLY REALLY WANT... WHAT I WANT WHAT I WANT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I..."
15986,That was totally worth it.
15987,"Oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind."
15988,Wait a minute. Are you trying to get dirt on Lisa?
15989,"Well, if that's your custom."
15990,Okay.
15991,"Well, she's into Buddhism, whistle-blowing, totally against pollution no matter what I say..."
15992,"Well, that loser Milhouse has always had a thing for her. Don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?"
15993,"I'm so sorry, honey. I said good things about you too. Check out the Lifestyle section: ""Plastic pearls make the girl."""
15994,"Oh, I can't stand seeing one of my children like this."
15995,I can still hear her. I'd better do something.
15996,"Marge, I'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. Put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers."
15997,"""All my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. I may be her father, but when I grow up, I wanna be just like her. Except still a dude."""
15998,"See, Lisa? Instead of one Big Shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions."
15999,You're the only one who won't shut up about it.
16000,Trying to get a Frisbee off the roof.
16001,"Oh, there's the Frisbee."
16002,"And while you're there, can you get my Frisbee off the ledge?"
16003,"Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?"
16004,"People's deaths, eh?"
16005,Do me! Do me!
16006,"So, what'd I die of? Too much happiness? Naked girl avalanche?"
16007,What kind of bread?
16008,Woo hoo!
16009,Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
16010,"Hey Chief, throw me your piece."
16011,"C'mon, shoot me a new one!"
16012,"Oh, I'm so scared. Ned Flanders is pointing a gun at me. You couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if I whacked the barrel like this."
16013,Never!
16014,"Fine, I'll never go back. Starting tomorrow. Today is Lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake."
16015,But ice cream cake...
16016,It sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
16017,Everything's comin' up Homer.
16018,"Hmmm, I wonder if I could blow up Heaven?"
16019,Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?
16020,You're not the boss of me.
16021,"Please spare me. I'm not a murderer, I'm not. And I've never known the pleasures of a woman... or a proper eating apple!"
16022,"Shrink ray? Oh, there's always something else to buy."
16023,"Hold on, Maggie! Daddy's coming!"
16024,I've got her!
16025,"Oh, Mag... No wait, this is yours."
16026,Captain!
16027,"Screw you, doc! I fly from the gut."
16028,"Bah! Has science ever kissed a woman, or won the Super Bowl, or put a man on the moon? This is what I think of your precious science."
16029,"Help me, science!"
16030,"Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
16031,Maybe this'll help.
16032,There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.
16033,"And to make sure we get there super fast, I'm hitting all the buttons with my palm."
16034,"We'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. Bart?... Lisa?..."
16035,"Fine, me."
16036,"I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!"
16037,"Boy, when God closes a door, he opens a window."
16038,I say when we're full. You don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside.
16039,I need a mouth hole. And some other holes too.
16040,I'VE GOT YOU DEEP IN THE HEART OF ME...
16041,"You know, Black Dracula is now a Congressman from Virginia."
16042,"Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself."
16043,Turn that down!
16044,"Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household."
16045,A slightly colder fridge? In my lifetime? Amazing.
16046,And check this out.
16047,"A walk-in microwave! Hey Marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done?"
16048,Uh-oh.
16049,And I kept that vow.
16050,"I'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie."
16051,"A contractor? Those guys are the biggest crooks around. They charge for materials and labor! Pick one, jerks!"
16052,"Man, that hurt. And now to do the exact same thing again."
16053,All right.
16054,Fine.
16055,Easy... easy...
16056,Trying to.
16057,But I need them for the articles!
16058,"Of course not. Why would I want to look at a nude woman I'm not even married to? I mean, I wouldn't even know how she could improve me."
16059,"Steady, steady..."
16060,"Thanks, Marge. I can't wait to read about ""Sport Fishing With Sonny Jurgensen."""
16061,What man would want you now?
16062,"There it is, nice and smooth. I'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job."
16063,"Oh, now you tell me."
16064,So that's what that white noise was.
16065,"Get lost, crook!"
16066,Why don't you just kiss her?
16067,How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.
16068,I was thinking of chicken wings.
16069,Those are good too.
16070,Your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
16071,"Marge, I don't want to freak you out, but I think I love you."
16072,"I'm proud of you, honey."
16073,Adult themes? What are you talking about?
16074,Stupid Bart. Bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
16075,"Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?"
16076,But she'll still win the contest?
16077,But win the contest?
16078,"Woo-hoo! If Marge becomes Auntie Ovenfresh, we'll meet all the food personalities..."
16079,"Look! It's Mister Cashew... the Koobler Dwarfs... Snip, Crinkle and Poof..."
16080,"Twinkle the Kidd, I love you!"
16081,Uh-oh.
16082,Blood for creme! Blood for creme!
16083,"Would you excuse us, Milton?"
16084,"Yeah, and your father's ""No House."" Now scram."
16085,"Maybe I was a little hard on him. Oh, well. Bart, I know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. But what's going on up here?"
16086,"Uh-um... What do you think ""some"" is?"
16087,"I thought I'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life."
16088,Do you know what a boob is?
16089,Good. That'll save us some time. Okay... why do you think your mother and I sleep in the same bed?
16090,Exactly. And we're poor because we have kids. And the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
16091,"Well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough."
16092,"And Marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house."
16093,"Hey, it keeps the kids quiet."
16094,"That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate."
16095,"Every Simpson starts with a circle. Daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. Hm, I'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an ""M"" and a ""G."""
16096,"You wanna know a little trick? To downsize my derrière, I just tie a sweater around it."
16097,See?
16098,"Oh, Homer, you're wasting away to nothing. You simply must eat something. Well, you're the boss!"
16099,"Oh, I love to see my man eat."
16100,"Nice try, loser. I bet you made up a fake test."
16101,All right.
16102,"Ah-ha! Here's a mistake. It says the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort. Dream on, pal."
16103,Really? Frankfurter... is that anything?
16104,"All right, boy, which con did you work here? Copy off another kid? Pay attention and take notes? Well, take note of this!"
16105,I thought you two broke up.
16106,"Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap."
16107,"So they're growing up. Soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of hours. And then, the peace of the grave."
16108,Open.
16109,"Well, that explains a lot. Who's hungry?"
16110,They're a family again. And so are we. What happened?
16111,"And Lisa, what have you learned?"
16112,"But talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?"
16113,"C'mon, say something conclusive."
16114,"Open-ended! C'mon, Lisa. Say everything's fine. Everything's fine."
16115,Prove it.
16116,Woo hoo! Free cheese!
16117,"What's happened to us, Marge? We used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. Then came the heart attacks."
16118,Woo hoo! The circus!
16119,Woo hoo! I don't know the difference!
16120,What about that two-headed goat?
16121,"Yes, but he came here to die."
16122,"One of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. How you solved crimes I'll never know."
16123,"Marge! I figured out a way we can get in on this Quimby lawsuit! Bart, go ahead."
16124,Huh? Huh?
16125,I sawed you on the television.
16126,I believe it was the school's tuba.
16127,"Chloe, these kebabs you made are as good or better than anything I've ever had at this table."
16128,"Oh Marge, I'm just being polite."
16129,More!
16130,"Oh come on, Marge. The only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet."
16131,I'm here! I'm here! Quit buggin' me!
16132,It's a conversation starter!
16133,I swallowed a chicken bone.
16134,Same one.
16135,"Good news, Marge!"
16136,I've learned to walk naked on stilts!
16137,"Oh Honey, her life can't compare to yours. You've got three kids, a TV tray from Expo sixty-seven, and you're married to King Stink!"
16138,"Marge, listen to me. Chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. You're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together."
16139,"I just hate to see you upset, honey. You know what would be a good name for Maggie? Chloe."
16140,Ladies! There's no need to fight over me.
16141,"Oh. Well then, carry on."
16142,"All right. But while I'm gone, boy, you think about what you did."
16143,You uh...
16144,"Why you little... need a reason for strangling, do ya... I'll fix your wagon!"
16145,And I'm growing ashamed of my penis.
16146,"Marge, that's crazy talk. Now look, I'll save Lisa. Your place is here with the women."
16147,"Okay, you go save Lisa. I'll stay here with the women."
16148,What do women want?!
16149,"Okay. I'll run as fast as I can, but I'm full of potato salad."
16150,"Chief, my daughter's up there. You're a father too."
16151,Pretend to care!
16152,Whew!
16153,I wouldn't say that.
16154,"Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle."
16155,"Yeah, that's how it starts."
16156,"Bart's shirt is a classic, Marge. Just like ""Keep On Truckin'"". As if I would ever want to stop truckin'."
16157,"I've been reading this magazine for years, but I never dreamed my son would be on the cover."
16158,You broke in!
16159,Yeah. Nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.
16160,Look at all that cash.
16161,"You know what, Mr. Burns? I'm never comin' back. My son's making so much cash in the T-shirt game, that I don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as I age."
16162,"Bart, can I ask you an important question?"
16163,Twenty-nine ninety-nine.
16164,Woo hoo!
16165,"Lenny, Carl! How ya doin'?"
16166,It's awesome. You know what I've gotten into? Sleeping 'til noon.
16167,"Hey, just 'cause I'm not working doesn't mean I can't gripe like you guys. Don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?"
16168,"Oh, I see what's goin' on. You can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence."
16169,"No problem. Bart, I need two hundred dollars."
16170,I broke some bathroom fixtures.
16171,"I'm pathetic? Because I take money from my ten-year-old son? Well, let me tell you something: I still call the shots around here!"
16172,I don't have an inside voice!
16173,The couch is like that tree!
16174,"Lisa, basic cable said I should nurture you."
16175,"Okay! You be the girl, and I'll be the car."
16176,"Screw the market, we're going to Mexico!"
16177,It's El Flanderito! Run him down!
16178,"Hey, what's that dealy?"
16179,"Oh, you'll win for sure. You and science go together like Lenny and Carl. The science is Carl."
16180,"Honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. Remember, I did used to work at a science factory."
16181,"Sweetie, that's orphan talk."
16182,Stupid atomic pile. How hard could it be to build a reactor? Korea did it. And look at the quality of their animation.
16183,"Hm... what to do, what to do?"
16184,"Hey, maybe the internet has the information I need! It certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement."
16185,www.nuclear-secrets.com.
16186,"Are you a terrorist? No. ""Would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?"" No. I will never tire of the bar scene!"
16187,"Let's see, I can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano..."
16188,All I need is some plutonium and I know just the place to get it.
16189,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!"
16190,"Sweetie, your Daddy's gonna show you just how much he loves you. You know that non-functioning nuclear reactor you built?"
16191,I juiced it up a little.
16192,"Oh, that's madiculous."
16193,I never complain about your frilly pillows.
16194,"What's the matter, boy?"
16195,"Son, when you grew up, I grew down. But now I can see you need your Dad more than ever."
16196,"Get back in the garage, old man."
16197,Stay out of my boxes!
16198,"You give my son what he deserves, or I'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!"
16199,"Sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. If I turn this dial..."
16200,"The resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those Blu-Blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear."
16201,Damn him to hell.
16202,Are you prepared to take that chance?
16203,"Not so fast. I also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of Bart's T-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat."
16204,"Yo, yo, yo! Keep it on the low flow!"
16205,I'm hangin' this over the mantel.
16206,"Well, I'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son."
16207,"Oh, I doubt it. But we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out."
16208,Par-ty! Par-ty! Par-ty!
16209,Re-straint! Re-straint! Re-straint!
16210,"Lighten up, Marge. This is my chance to relax with people from work I never get to see. Like this guy."
16211,Really? How'm I doin'?
16212,"Nice tux, Moe."
16213,"Hey, it's a guy in a goofy Burns head!"
16214,Act like Burns!
16215,That's him to a T!
16216,"Wow, a wooden plane. It's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks."
16217,What a magical party this has been. Mr. Burns is a great man.
16218,"C'mon, Marge. This place is great. Free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future."
16219,"Spill it, Super-boss!"
16220,"I'll get a second job. One that pays well. You think those guys on ""Friends"" need another friend?"
16221,"Dammit! I would've been perfect as Rachel's Irish cousin. So you're all doing each other, are ya? Well, who's going to put out for old Seamus?"
16222,I need a new job that provides full health benefits.
16223,#NAME?
16224,Phobos? That's a good job for me.
16225,I declare that you have the most beautiful brown eyes.
16226,Dad?
16227,"The border, eh? Then I'd better sand off my fingerprints."
16228,"I could just wear gloves. Nah, they're upstairs."
16229,"Hola, Señor. We are gringos who wish to spend mucho dinero in your country."
16230,Drugs! Various drugs! Be sure to read instructions! Uh-oh! Where'd I put the instructions?
16231,Marge? Bart? Lisa?
16232,"Wow, this is just like Hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. What gives?"
16233,"Oh man, I need something to settle my stomach."
16234,Oh wait. I was supposed to take these with food.
16235,"Why the sweet talk, Apu? Are you after some cheap drugs?"
16236,"Flanders? I don't know... I mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday."
16237,Hold on. We're just innocent tourists.
16238,No cameras?
16239,"Listen you two, I'll tell you who the true God is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!"
16240,"All right, I'm comin' back there."
16241,My butt looks so huge during perp walks.
16242,"Dad, you tried your best. For the first time in my life I can say, without being drunk, that I truly admire you."
16243,There are other ways to get into Canada...
16244,"That's it, a plane!"
16245,Sure it will. All we need is a pilot!
16246,Katharine Hepburn?!
16247,"We really appreciate your help, Johnny. Is there any way we can repay ya?"
16248,Really? In America we do it four times a week. You come on down and I'll get us front row seats.
16249,Don't dump me out! I can lose weight! Just give me a chance.
16250,"One... two... Eh, I'd rather die."
16251,"Well, at least we're all in this together."
16252,"We'll make it, Dad. On a wing and a prayer."
16253,Dammit.
16254,"Great news, honey! Burns made me a freelance consultant!"
16255,"Hey, what's this lump?"
16256,"See you in Hell, document!"
16257,"Now remember to eat smart, people. Go for the fancy foods -- don't let 'em fill you up with THAT cheap stuff."
16258,Screw you.
16259,Smoked salmon... Shrimp... Crab legs!
16260,I win...
16261,"I've never been so embarrassed. And the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! I'll see you all at lupper!"
16262,"Why did I ever have kids? I could have written symphonies, or been Shakespeare."
16263,"Oh, who are you, the health inspector?"
16264,"Moe's, a tribute. ""M"" is for Moe, the owner of Moe's. ""O"" is for the ""O"" in the middle of Moe's. ""E"" is for acceptance. The feeling I always got here at Moe's. Oh Moe, don't let 'em close you down!"
16265,"I can't go to a gay bar, I'm too fat! Moe, I'm gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes."
16266,... Marge?
16267,Put up my house? But I just paid it off... what would Marge say?
16268,"Okay honey, I'll do it."
16269,That was me.
16270,Marge! How dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?
16271,I had to! Or Moe's would stay closed forever!
16272,"Look, look. I can see you're upset. If you need me, I'll be at Moe's."
16273,"Marge, you can't go with me to Moe's. I mean, how would you like it if I came with you to your mother's?"
16274,That's because I hate her.
16275,Just made it!
16276,"Boy, I can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold..."
16277,"But I don't wanna take care of the kids... Um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? Bart sleeps in the microwave, right?"
16278,"How many magic beans should I sell the baby for? Three? Duh, der, duh. That's me, jerk-ass Homer. Duh, der, doy."
16279,Just what are you inferring?
16280,"Whew, that's a relief!"
16281,"Ah yes, Detroit-style. Very nice. So, you've been at Moe's every night this week."
16282,Bonded?! How many times?
16283,"Thanks, honey. My mind is completely at ease."
16284,"Well, I might as well use this pucker for something."
16285,"Oh Marge, don't you love it when our hands meet in the popcorn tub?"
16286,Hey Moe... haven't seen you in a while.
16287,How do you know about that?
16288,You do?
16289,"Well... I'm worried about Marge and Moe. They've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. But it's not physical. So everything's great, right?"
16290,Can I learn it at a happy place?
16291,What do I do?
16292,You're absolutely right! Stop this ride!
16293,"Marge, my darling! Thank God you're home! I've been dying to hear your feelings!"
16294,"Well, I can go all night, baby. I could listen to you two, maybe three, times."
16295,Catch your flight?
16296,What's a cuckold?
16297,He's only your emotional uncle! I'm your real uncle!
16298,I'm off!
16299,"Hang on, Marge, Homie's comin'! I won't let that man make you happy!"
16300,But I have to get to the airport to save my marriage!
16301,"You gotta get me closer, Chief!"
16302,Marge!
16303,Toilet hole.
16304,You leave my wife alone!
16305,Uh... ice?
16306,"Oh, it's true. I don't know Marge at all. I'll just go home now."
16307,"Moe, you've won. I'll see you at baggage claim."
16308,"Marge, I just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on Moe, here's my card."
16309,And you're my Margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.
16310,"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I chew in my sleep."
16311,THINK OF ME BABE WHENEVER / SOME SWEET TALKING GUY IN A THONG / HANDS YOU A BONG / DON'T TAKE...
16312,YOU BETTER BE STRONG
16313,'CAUSE I WANT A SANDWICH
16314,OR MAYBE A MANWICH...
16315,"Oh, the prid is gone."
16316,"Oh, I've only got a hundred dollars. I'd better bid shrewdly."
16317,One hundred dollars!
16318,"Dammit! I never win anything! Ooh, here's something I'm good at."
16319,Easy... gentle...
16320,"I'm number one! I beat my son! Victory is mine, so kiss my behind!"
16321,"Boon chacalacala / / In your face! / My son flips frogs like a girl, yeah! A-boom! A-ba! A who's your daddy?"
16322,Sure do.
16323,I'm happy!
16324,Stupid internet... whole world laughing at me...
16325,The internet wasn't created for mockery. It was supposed to help researchers at different universities share data sets. It was!
16326,I know why you're here. You wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. Well fine.
16327,Woo hoo! But why?
16328,You wanna do my dance after you score?
16329,Woo-hoo!
16330,"""L"" is for ""loser,"" which describes you, sir. Don't try to stop me. Just enjoy the view, sir."
16331,"Honey, I bet you're wondering why Daddy's not at work again. The answer may surprise you. I have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player."
16332,"Don't forget showboating. That's the cornerstone of my ""Pyramid of Success."""
16333,"Ooh, I forgot crotch grabbing. That'll be the sun."
16334,"After you prance across the goal line, you hurl the other team's mascot to the ground, and drive your cleats into his neck!"
16335,"You're goin' down, you potato-eatin' pansy!"
16336,Y'ello.
16337,I think I can fit you in. Let's see...
16338,"Lenny, can I move you from Wednesday at noon to Sunday at six?"
16339,"All right, all right, I'll work it out."
16340,"Welcome to the ""Homer Simpson Showboating Academy."""
16341,Today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
16342,"First, I want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure."
16343,Nicely done.
16344,"This is either about me, or steroids."
16345,I'm the worst thing to happen to sports since Fox.
16346,I wanna see him too. Maybe he can tell me how to get this off.
16347,It soaked through to the other side!
16348,"Wow. At last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. You suckers, I would have done it for free!"
16349,"Dammit! Well, I'll still do it. You suckers, I would have paid you."
16350,Dammit! Will you take a check?
16351,Dammit!
16352,Every single Super Bowl halftime show has been great.
16353,I don't know. It's a lot of pressure. Do many people watch the Super Bowl?
16354,"Uh... uh... Oh man, I have no idea what I'm going."
16355,I wonder if other Super Bowl producers waited until three in the morning the night before to plan their halftime shows.
16356,A church! Maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas.
16357,"Flanders. Eh, I guess you've got some late night problems too."
16358,Have you tried checking the oil filter?
16359,"Sure, I'd be happy to tell you my problem. I've got a venue the whole world will be watching, and nothing to fill it with."
16360,"Yeah... you help me, and I, in turn, am helped by you."
16361,"We now take you back through the ages, to a time before TV, before cowboys, before dinosaurs. The time of the Bible!"
16362,The children of God once lived according to their Father's laws.
16363,"But then a shadow of wickedness fell across the land, as represented by this cloud of white pesticide!"
16364,But there was one righteous man: Noah!
16365,"Oh mighty God, send a flood to destroy this wickedness."
16366,"After forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and Noah sent forth a single dove..."
16367,I thought America was hungry for meaning. I should have just sent a crocodile into space like I originally planned.
16368,"Welcome to the ""Homer Simpson Showboating Academy."""
16369,Today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
16370,"Quiet, you!"
16371,Go Seminoles! Cover-the-point-spread! Cover-the-point-spread!
16372,"Where's the remote! This is not a drill, people!"
16373,Barf for your master!
16374,Lousy American-made dog!
16375,Why must I be so voluptuous?
16376,How do I look?
16377,"After my makeover I'm gonna get you, boy."
16378,Go to Hell.
16379,"Fine, go nuts."
16380,"I love you too, Jerry."
16381,"Son, your mother makes a very loud point..."
16382,"Boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand."
16383,"YOU DID IT ON THE STRAIGHT, GOT YOUR DAD'S PERMISSION / BUT YOUR MOM DROPPED A BOMB, SO I FLIPPED MY POSITION"
16384,"BABY BOY, BABY BOY, BA-BA-BA-BABY BOY"
16385,Bart's gone! I checked everywhere!
16386,"If that's true, he's gonna be like NWA -- Not Without Ass-welts."
16387,A flying rock! Call a geologist!
16388,Follow instructions? He's doomed!
16389,This'll be the worst Thanksgiving dinner ever.
16390,The bad news keeps on coming.
16391,Y'ello?
16392,Oh yeah? Send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.
16393,I know what I'm doing. You can use any section of the paper. Except Metro. It's a big snooze.
16394,Oh son!... Taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing I've ever done.
16395,"...Bart was never kidnapped! Lisa, I'm very glad you brought me this. I'll see that it gets to the proper authorities."
16396,"Hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which I've already lost, for the rights to Bart's story. So I have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true."
16397,What shirt? I don't see any shirt.
16398,Burn the truth. Burn the truth.
16399,You leave Maggie to me.
16400,Not her! She'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!
16401,"Wow, those jackets are beautiful."
16402,The lie is love.
16403,Love the lie!
16404,"Yeah, be cool. Like us."
16405,"Coolee, coolee cool! C'mon, fool! Be coolee, coolee cool!"
16406,"Lisa, the world is a very complicated place. And when you get right down to it... cannonball!"
16407,"Eh, who needs tourists? They never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway."
16408,"Have you read them all? Okay, good."
16409,"Two hundred bucks a couple, eh?"
16410,"Hey, I gotta get in on this! These people have rights! The right to buy me a sixty-two inch TV!"
16411,Now begins the long and spiritual journey to becoming an ordained minister.
16412,"Let's see, ""Name"" ""Homer Simpson""."
16413,"Now to answer all the pop-ups. Ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. That's only fair."
16414,"...And do you, Julio, take Thad to be your lawful wedded life partner, in Massachusetts and Vermont... maybe Canada... stay outta Texas... as long as you both are gay?"
16415,It brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. Photo mouse pads for sale out back.
16416,"Okay, what's next? Adam and Steve or Madam and Eve?"
16417,"Hey, what can I say? I love love."
16418,Hm... where's Lenny and Carl?
16419,"But I'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars."
16420,Opposite? Yuck!!
16421,"Hm. Well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. What's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?"
16422,"Ooh, look at me. I'm straight as a one dollar bill. La de da. Ooh."
16423,Do you Cletus take Brandine to be...
16424,Wait a minute! Are you two brother and sister?
16425,"Please, Kent. Call me Your Holiness."
16426,"Oh Kent, not anything. It has to exist. Or does it?"
16427,"If you love the Bible so much, why don't you marry it? In fact, I now pronounce you and the Bible man and wife. And you're the wife. You owe me two hundred bucks."
16428,Which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. Which will put more green in the blue. The blue being my pants.
16429,Lemme get my belt sander. Maybe I can grind the ugly off your face.
16430,I wasn't joking.
16431,"Yeah, big surprise. Hey Marge, here's another bomb: I like beer."
16432,"Marge, I'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you for a sausage patty than your sister Patty."
16433,"Now Patty, here's a veil I picked out just for you."
16434,Give it back!
16435,"Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard. And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it."
16436,Correction. The first blimp that got her pregnant.
16437,Why you little...
16438,Save my place.
16439,"Yeah, ""Bride of the Monster."""
16440,Got him! Uh-oh.
16441,"Oh Lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as I consecrate another gay union that angers you so."
16442,And please let thy Holy Spirit open the heart of my wife. Amen.
16443,You handsome devil. Someday they'll let you and me get married! Can you imagine the children?
16444,"I love you, Homer... I love you too, Homer... Oh, Homer."
16445,"Queerly beloved, we're here to join Veronica and Patty in matrimony. But the news isn't all good. They've written their own vows. Patty?"
16446,Next!
16447,"If anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace."
16448,"People please, can we wrap this up? It's gonna rain and I've gotta get the bikes in here."
16449,"Patty, I admire your decision. It takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. So I'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge."
16450,"Oh, I just love it here. So many things, and so many things of each thing!"
16451,"Oh, Dad. How I'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base..."
16452,"Dad, where's your base?!"
16453,"Eh, they'll be fine."
16454,"Welcome to Sprawl*Mart... Pimple cream in aisle five! Buenos nachos -- ask about our señor discount. Hey, Rabbi, Jesus loves ya. Just kidding."
16455,That coot happens to be my father. Please continue.
16456,Is there a chance for advancement?
16457,Woo hoo! No pressure!
16458,"Aw, dammit! Chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?"
16459,"Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution."
16460,"This twenty-foot pole will make Bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. And I used my Sprawl*Mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. It'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!"
16461,Show you what it's like in the real world!
16462,"Yeah, he's all ""Cowabunga, dude!"" What's that mean? Nothing, I bet."
16463,Woo hoo! That's been my dream ever since I heard it existed right now. What do I get?
16464,I won't do it.
16465,But I'm a U.S. citizen.
16466,Dios mio!
16467,"Sorry, boy. This is the only place that's two hundred feet from Lisa but still on our property."
16468,"Hey, why'd you lock the door? We're still inside!"
16469,"I've never worked all night, never! And I worked at an all-night diner for three years! I slept on the grill."
16470,You monster!
16471,"That's it, mister. I am disgruntled. And up until now, I was relatively gruntled!"
16472,I did it! I pulled it out! And with no brain damage-amage-amage-amage-amage-amage.
16473,"Now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!"
16474,Really? Then why do you still work here?!
16475,I'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
16476,"Mmm, hot dog."
16477,I just don't understand what the problem is.
16478,"Son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters."
16479,"And it's something to be feared -- right, Doctor?"
16480,"Come on kids, we should go. Goodbye, Selma."
16481,I know. That was for the other patients.
16482,My thingies!
16483,"Great, another job lost to a foreigner."
16484,I just felt a chill go through my very soul.
16485,"How about that Selma, flying all of us to China for no apparent reason?"
16486,"And how 'bout me getting off work by saying I'm teaching math skills to inner city youths. Yes, there are many kinds of heroes."
16487,"Hey look, a dragon."
16488,I'll give you one.
16489,Hey dragon! You fly like a girl!
16490,"You name it, oh wise mountain ape."
16491,Nooooooo!!
16492,"But Marge, I don't want her to be happy."
16493,Deal.
16494,"Okay, I'll do it. Because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. Ha-ha, now we're even!"
16495,"Wow, it makes the Lincoln Memorial look like crap."
16496,"And this is Marge, our surprisingly hot nanny."
16497,"Don't mention it, Miss October. But don't look at her passport, it's different."
16498,"I've heard of these guys. You can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it."
16499,Wha?
16500,I hope you washed your hands first.
16501,"Oh, look at him sleeping. He's like a little angel that killed fifty million people. Yes you are... yes you are!"
16502,I finally get this play!
16503,I'm a nuclear--
16504,I'm a Chinese acrobat!
16505,You guys are commies? Then why am I seeing rudimentary free markets?
16506,"Nice chair toss. Good one, skinny. / You guys get these chairs from Regal Rents? / Boy, you're a great stacker. / Hi, Lisa. / Now that's precarious."
16507,"Boy, this is easy. Maybe I am the world's greatest acrobat."
16508,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.--
16509,A.
16510,"Ooh, you're curing me with acupuncture."
16511,Awww. She likes my eyes.
16512,"I would, but Marge would kill me... I mean ohh, right."
16513,"It wasn't easy, Marge -- I've missed you so much."
16514,Is there any other kind?
16515,"Wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate."
16516,I am so sorry about what happened. But at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.
16517,Who told you that?
16518,Now let's see... which one is Ling?
16519,Ling?... Ling?... Ling?...
16520,Ling!
16521,"I was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. But I don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours."
16522,But he loves me.
16523,Why you little... I'll endanger you!
16524,Something's wrong with Bart. He's acting weird.
16525,"Wait, you're not Bart! Eh, close enough."
16526,Hmmm. Seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. I'll keep one.
16527,"Let's see now... ""Kill spiders?"" We don't have spiders."
16528,Stupid spider... afraid of dying.
16529,Aha! Huh?
16530,Spider poison is people poison?!
16531,Baaart!
16532,"Hm, where's the pain? There it is!"
16533,A spider!
16534,"Don't worry. If I croak, you'll marry Lenny. Or Moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game I invented. I got all the rules written down... up here."
16535,"Sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. But I'm not gonna die for many, many years."
16536,Haven't we all?
16537,"None. No wait, three. Since the last one, I don't remember so good."
16538,Yes I am.
16539,Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!
16540,"If I sign it, it still counts!"
16541,My hemophilia!
16542,Uninsurable?!
16543,Huh?
16544,"Way ahead of you, Marge -- I just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. They should get here soon. I paid a bundle for over-night delivery."
16545,Okay. I'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense!
16546,Directory assistance?
16547,"Well, I'll get a lawyer on that. No, a whole team of lawyers. Who will dine on mustard flown in from the Orient."
16548,"I'm sorry, Moe. Marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!"
16549,It's my money... I'm the one who earns it... drinking beer out of a thermos like an animal...
16550,"Marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far."
16551,"You can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?"
16552,"Hey, I earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, I'm at work busting my hump."
16553,"Yes, President Franklin."
16554,"Well, I invented a Popsicle made of Mountain Dew."
16555,You banged?
16556,"No, I spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. I need a castle where I can be king!"
16557,Dammit!
16558,"Kids, your mother and I have decided to take a little break from each other. While we deal with our issues, I plan to go on ""Motorhome Makeover"" and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. All I need is for someone to start a show called ""Motorhome Makeover."""
16559,"Hey, I couldn't leave you kids. You're like my own family. Now check this place out!"
16560,I've got Gameboys and caramel apples!
16561,I'll let you punch me!
16562,We'll have Christmas tomorrow!
16563,Woo hoo! Free gas!
16564,"Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival."
16565,"Hmmm. A place to dock, eh? I got room -- I have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot."
16566,Are you crazy? Let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
16567,It's a deal! Woo hoo!
16568,"Welcome, welcome. If my wife asks, you're here for a Boz Skaggs concert."
16569,These are my new friends. They like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.
16570,That's a lot of places.
16571,"Sorry, Marge. We've got the power now. And you can't turn us off!"
16572,That's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
16573,Name one way I'm not!
16574,I seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!
16575,I'm Marge Simpson. Don't eat off the floor.
16576,That was my Woodstock!
16577,"Oh yeah, Marge? What about my womanly needs?"
16578,"Hey, that judge thought I rocked. Case closed! Although my case is still open."
16579,"If you need me, I'll be in my trailer!"
16580,"My RV is gone! It was more than a motor home. It was a car I could go to the bathroom in. Hey, a note."
16581,"Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone."
16582,Don't worry about the SUVs. There's a gentle curve up ahead.
16583,Bart! Pull over!
16584,I'm not a machine -- I can't just turn it on!
16585,Why you little...!
16586,Thank God for that Turkish freighter. Now we'll just go get 'em and...
16587,"Bring back our children, you Cyprus-splitting jerks!"
16588,Will you raise them Christian?
16589,Noooo!
16590,"Wow, Marge -- once again, your Mom-ly wisdom averted disaster."
16591,And I promise I will return this RV first thing in the morning. Easy... easy... easy... easy...
16592,"Marge, you're taking this pretty well."
16593,Cool.
16594,"Look, we'll compromise. We'll go see a play...that Lisa doesn't want to see."
16595,Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!
16596,"Hey cat, get your own pants!"
16597,Kids! Why's the cat so fat?
16598,Make it seven!
16599,There must have been a mistake. My body is a temple.
16600,But he misread my pee! He misread my peeeee!
16601,"Stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. Everyone gets a prison job but me. All my best friends are guards. They think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not."
16602,Sometimes I go to the movies alone.
16603,I'm not supposed to be new meat. I'm supposed to have your job.
16604,"Oh my God! That man might be hurt! Guards, there's a prisoner in there!"
16605,"Squealin'? No, I just wanted to help him."
16606,"Really? You mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?"
16607,"Mr. Burns, I've thought about it, and I don't wanna be a snitch. It's not an honorable life."
16608,"Well, I am a sucker for a little hat."
16609,Well... I don't know.
16610,"Well, I would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. I've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. Okay, you've found your snitch."
16611,Homer Simpson has become a snitch.
16612,"Say, is that a gang tattoo? I thought those weren't allowed."
16613,"That's right, an unauthorized tattoo. I came here right away."
16614,"Who? Oh, that ""my mother."" Tell him thanks."
16615,"Well, if you really must know..."
16616,I'm a prison snitch.
16617,"Sure, they're on top of the world. Then there's a big riot scene. Then I don't know, I usually doze off."
16618,What are you dopes lookin' at? You've never seen bling-bling before?
16619,How come nobody told me before?
16620,There's gonna be a breakout tonight.
16621,Deal!
16622,"What happened to the guards?! Okay, okay. Don't panic. Maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant."
16623,"Marge, they're gonna kill me! I only did what I had to do to survive... in a style befitting a French monarch."
16624,"Fly, Segway! Fly!"
16625,Marge! How did you get in here?
16626,"Marge, c'mon!"
16627,We'll be safe in the gas chamber.
16628,"Marge, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Can I snitch on my heart and say... ""I love you""?"
16629,"Hold on a minute. Governor, I've been using my powers of snitching for evil. But now I want to tattle for good. This prison is a hellhole. They feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!"
16630,The guards are sadistic and cruel!
16631,You know what I missed in the joint? Just lying here watching you sleeping sweetly... sleeping sweetly...
16632,...sleeping sweetly...
16633,I won't tell if you don't tell.
16634,"Listen to me! This whole building is unsafe. They cut corners everywhere. People, it's a death trap!"
16635,How do you know the title of my prophetic vision?
16636,What'd I miss? What'd I miss?
16637,"Well, maybe I was partying so hard with my single friends last night, I forgot the rules."
16638,Why? Is it messing you up?
16639,"Stupid wildlife, serves 'em right."
16640,"Oh, Marge..."
16641,"Oh, right. Separated."
16642,"Son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your Mom."
16643,"She'll realize she was a fool, when..."
16644,Hey! Come back with my patio furniture!
16645,"Stupid flounders. Hey, I've got a great idea. We'll find some new lady friends."
16646,"C'mon, boy, we're hitting the town. After decompressing, of course."
16647,There's a DVD player but it doesn't work.
16648,I know! It's a hover car!
16649,"You wish, loser!"
16650,"Hey Moe, hey Moe-clone."
16651,"Boy, I think I see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. E-Z."
16652,"Son, say hello to Edna."
16653,Oopsie.
16654,"Hey Marge, why are you with Krusty? These kids are too old for clowns."
16655,"Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. We split up, it's all cool, I... I'll kill you!"
16656,Much better.
16657,"Marge, I thought you'd never take me back after what I did to Krusty."
16658,Exactly.
16659,You don't know the half of it.
16660,"Don't worry, Marge -- Hot Wheels to the rescue!"
16661,"The water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked S-turns..."
16662,Around the loop of death...And out the mail slot! Then it's the yard's problem.
16663,"Aw, that's it. I'm going to Moe's!"
16664,It's raining outside.
16665,Lousy cat.
16666,Stupid Homer-hating family. At least there's one place I'm always welcome.
16667,"Aw, guys. This is just what I needed."
16668,So what's Stephen Hawking doing here?
16669,So why didn't you invite me?
16670,I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny.
16671,I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
16672,"Hey, watch what you say about him. I think Ray could be the one."
16673,"Well, I can see I'm not wanted here."
16674,My family hates me... my stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party! They'll all be sorry when I invent the world's best-tasting cola... and share it with no one!
16675,A sign!
16676,"Finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women."
16677,I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.
16678,How did it ever come to this? I'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. I don't have a friend in the world.
16679,The sun.
16680,"Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am."
16681,"Mine. Oh, move your hand. I get this!"
16682,"Ray, you know me better than anyone. How can I get my wife to love me again?"
16683,"Ray, will you help me fix my roof?"
16684,"Wait, did I add that right?"
16685,To my new buddy. Now all we need is an awesome theme song. Whatever plays next on the jukebox.
16686,Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely.
16687,I think that means six more weeks of Autumn.
16688,"Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where."
16689,How did you know?
16690,"You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats."
16691,High-five!
16692,Ray would high-five me.
16693,Oh Ray! You came at the agreed-upon time.
16694,Impresses. What a big word! I'm gonna look that up.
16695,I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.
16696,"Some day that bowl will overflow, and I'll be there."
16697,"Sorry about that, pal."
16698,"One, two, three, four -- I declare a nail war!"
16699,"Ned, are you okay?"
16700,That's Ned Flanders. There's one in every neighborhood.
16701,"Goodbye, Ray! Bye! Oh, he turned the corner. Ooh! Now I see him again!"
16702,Don't worry -- Ray'll be back any minute.
16703,"My new best friend. We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches..."
16704,Ray's not gonna like that.
16705,"Well if I was, we'd have taller kids!"
16706,"You know son, my dad used to take me down to Johnson's Hardware. Old man Johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. When they built this place, he hung himself."
16707,"Oh sorry, son. I wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. Hey, Ray's here!"
16708,What's in the box?
16709,Of course we are! If you wanna be.
16710,I don't have to -- Ray's gonna be here any minute.
16711,"All right, then you can just look at the portrait I painted of him."
16712,Something like that.
16713,Did you make enough for Ray?
16714,He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now.
16715,Now. Now. Nnnow.
16716,Oh thank God. Where is he? Tell me!
16717,Ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.
16718,"Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see!"
16719,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!"
16720,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
16721,What's going on? Where are my shoes?
16722,What am I doing here? Let me go!
16723,"Fine, I admit it. Help me, Ray! Appear and strike them down!"
16724,"But that's not true, Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn."
16725,"Flanders, you saw Ray on the roof with me!"
16726,"Ned, are you okay?"
16727,There has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like Flanders and Bart... Wait! The bartender at Knockers.
16728,"Wow. My subconscious is a genius. Well, that's all very convincing, and..."
16729,"Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, doc!"
16730,"Aw, what did he die of?"
16731,Sorry. Give me one that doesn't taste so good.
16732,"Marge, write that down so we can have it at home."
16733,"Nope, just you, Marge and Yogi Bear. Kidding!"
16734,Real.
16735,Not real.
16736,Real.
16737,Real.
16738,Fascinating!
16739,"Oh kids, I heart you, too!"
16740,"Man, I'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. Although to be honest, I did enjoy lying down."
16741,It's Ray! I see him again! Monster! You don't exist.
16742,The awesome power of the human mind.
16743,"So, Ray does exist?!"
16744,Wait a minute. I went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. Somebody owes me big!
16745,That's a given! There's something else. Something much more else.
16746,"Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't."
16747,What are you talking about?
16748,What time's the show on?
16749,And what's the network?
16750,At what time?
16751,"And if I wanna watch it, what day?"
16752,And this is on the radio?
16753,"And if I wanna see it, what time should I watch it?"
16754,On what channel?
16755,What day?
16756,On the radio?
16757,Turn the television to what channel?
16758,At what time?
16759,"Now if I wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it?"
16760,And what time? Would be a good time to see it?
16761,So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock...
16762,"So it's Mondays at nine, on NBC."
16763,CBS.
16764,On the radio.
16765,Television at three o'clock.
16766,"Marge, no machine could ever replace you. Why you-- or could it?"
16767,Marge-bot! I'm ready for some lovin'!
16768,Why did I give her a gun? But I repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. Until all the kinks are worked out.
16769,"Aw, my little boy's in love."
16770,"C'mon, son. You can fight this. Do the Bartman. Do the Bartman!"
16771,Why don't you dance? Dance?!
16772,"Doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. They're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats."
16773,"You get better, son. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the ""library."""
16774,"Milkshake Festival. Look, you can see the booths from your window."
16775,"Lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. C'mon, everybody get in here. Hurry."
16776,"Overeating. And if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. But there won't be time."
16777,"Wow, he's just the kind of weirdo Bart needs."
16778,"Son, I just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. Leave your body. Make lots of friends!"
16779,"That freeloading fatso! Marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?"
16780,So that's where my soot went!
16781,"Even better, I'll ask him for my job back."
16782,Youth? I hate them. Secondly...
16783,"How much is got, Wolfgang Schmuck?"
16784,Fifty dollars? What about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
16785,"Güten abend, my brave, Bavarian Overlords. The best wurst in town."
16786,NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS / AUF IHREM WEG ZUM HORIZONT / HIELT MAN FUER UFOS AUS DEM ALL / DARUM SCHICKTE EIN GENERAL /
16787,"EINE FLIEGERSTAFFEL HINTERHER / ALARM ZU GEBEN, WENN ES SO WAR / DABEI WAR DA AM HORIZONT / NUR NEUNUNDNEUNZIG LUFTBALLONS"
16788,"Did you hear that Foxy, the Fox network Fox?"
16789,Oh boy.
16790,"Marge, I know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to..."
16791,Time to take out the Euro-trash.
16792,"Now, everything's perfect again."
16793,But who else needs to lose weight? Maggie? Grampa? My seldom-seen half brother Herb?
16794,Why is everyone looking at me?
16795,"I am not too fat. I'm alive, aren't I?"
16796,"Oh, that's terrible."
16797,Where will I sleep?
16798,Cheeseburger.
16799,I don't wanna.
16800,Here's a corner.
16801,You're a selfish jerk.
16802,But it's my burger.
16803,Fine. I'd rather die.
16804,I need change for a dollar.
16805,What's the cheapest thing you've got?
16806,Five ninety-nine?! What a rip-off! Someone should shoot you!
16807,Interesting. It's like a corndog without the dog.
16808,"I don't miss meat at all. This Portobello mushroom eats like a steak. A rubbery, fungus-like steak."
16809,"Marge, I'm giving birth to a food baby."
16810,I think it's staying down. It's staying down! It's not staying down.
16811,"Wait. Yes, it's staying down. Oh no, it's not! Yes it is. No it's not! Yep. No. Yep. No! Yep. No! Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. no."
16812,Where's my bucket?!
16813,Lisa sings so sweetly and Bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.
16814,"And she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. Oh, thank you for this angel, Lord!"
16815,"Don't lose hope, sweetie. I'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. And that's not just the beer talking. Your father's in here too."
16816,"Here you go, honey. Sing this."
16817,"Much of the tune is plagiarized. Now go, go, go!"
16818,"You did it, sweetie!"
16819,"Of course, Sweetie. You and I are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken Hellhole."
16820,"I wrote it about Shelbyville, then changed the names."
16821,"Good job, sweetie. Every time you hit that note, I'll shoot a glass with my BB gun."
16822,"Honey, our time together is precious to me. I didn't want to say anything, but I don't think I'm gonna be around much longer."
16823,"Well, Moe's getting a big screen TV in February. Just in time for the Pro Bowl. Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win."
16824,Let Daddy go talk to the man.
16825,May I have a word with you?
16826,"Is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'Cause I can make it greener..."
16827,"Don't worry honey, the song I wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""Moon River"" sound like a farting Orangutan."
16828,"Marge, Lisa and I were just discussing how to improve tonight's performance. Now you're confusing her by telling her she was perfect."
16829,My little girl likes Red Vines! You little...
16830,You think I can't kill you? There's a hundred little punks graduating from Syracuse this year that would beg to kiss my ass! Get outta here!
16831,"Hey, these are Red Vines. Here you go, sweetie. Daddy got you your candy."
16832,"Hey, gimme a break. Living through Lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me."
16833,You love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.
16834,Then would you like to see it getting made?
16835,Fired... me?
16836,"Everything I did, I did for you."
16837,Do you know the hours I worked? The people I had to yell at? The tires I had to slash?
16838,It's called smoozing!
16839,"Hey, come back! I'm calming down! We'll have family fun! Family funnnnn!"
16840,"Hey, everybody...I brought a guest."
16841,Someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.
16842,Ha! Smart move. Soon the whole world will be lining up to suck my nose. After I make my new client a star.
16843,"His name isn't Cameron anymore. He's now ""Johnny Rainbow."""
16844,I'm not Mr. Simpson. That ship has sailed. I'm Colonel Cool! And I'm the Captain on this rocket to the stars.
16845,Neither. I'm both.
16846,"All right, I wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands."
16847,Don't stop till it's as natural as breathing.
16848,Marge. Bart. Maggie. Santa's Little Helper. Lisa!
16849,I don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better.
16850,"Oh God! Oh, they're delicious! Oh, so happy! Oh God, they're... They're gone."
16851,We are!
16852,Flanders?
16853,"Okay Morty, gimme a rose-colored spot, tight to the mid-chest and an aqua background with an astronaut on a surfboard."
16854,Lisa.
16855,"Um, at the end of your song, remember to look into the spotlight. It makes your eyes twinkle."
16856,You're welcome.
16857,"I always was, honey. Look. Cameron's about to sing the song I wrote for him. He's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business."
16858,"Sure did. I'd do anything for you, honey. Especially if it's easy."
16859,I'll always be there. Not even death will stop me.
16860,"How 'bout ""I love you, honey?"""
16861,"Kids, wanna go to the mall?! They're baking fresh Cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!"
16862,"Oh, I love you, Dumpster-bons."
16863,"Oh, big surprise. The fat guy's eating garbage."
16864,"""Left Below."" Ooh, a ""He Is Risen"" production!"
16865,"Finally, a character I can relate to. I bet good things happen to him."
16866,Left below?! Where have I heard that before?
16867,It's everywhere!
16868,"This movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like Cannonball Run Two."
16869,Marge... what if the Rapture is coming and I haven't led a good enough life? I could be... left below!
16870,"Yeah, I'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. Thanks Marge, you've put my mind at ease. Now how about a little ""rapture"" for Mama?"
16871,"Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship."
16872,Marge is right -- the Rapture isn't coming! There haven't been any ominous signs!
16873,Blood is raining from the sky!
16874,Judgment day is at hand.
16875,"Begat. Uh, do you have any books on the Rapture?"
16876,I'll take everything you've got!
16877,"No, thank you."
16878,"Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh."
16879,This whole deal is scientifically proven. The Book of Revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at The Last Supper...
16880,...minus the number of Filipinos in the Bible...And you get...
16881,"He writes ""3150518"" on the board."
16882,Up bup bup!
16883,"Three fifteen p.m., May 18th! That's when the Rapture will be!"
16884,A week? That's...seven days from now!
16885,The world will end next week! Spend your children's college fund! Thaw that turkey now!
16886,"Funny story, Kent. It's the end of the world! God loves you! He's gonna kill you!"
16887,"Here's my angle: there's no way in God's Heaven I should get into God's Heaven. But maybe he'll let me in, if I warn others the Apocalypse is coming, as I previously shouted."
16888,Uhhh...
16889,"Here's one -- Revelation 6:13. Just before the Rapture, ""the stars will fall to the Earth."" So all you hippies out there might want to for that one."
16890,"Marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane."
16891,Well... I guess this thing does look pretty silly. Let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch TV.
16892,"When the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here."
16893,"Exactly. It came to me in a vision. Or maybe it was a drunken haze. Or, possibly, an ice cream headache."
16894,"No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested."
16895,"All right, everybody. Pair up with a Rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity."
16896,"But sweetheart, I have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this."
16897,"C'mon, Lisa. No one in this family is being left below."
16898,"Don't worry, Dad! There's a bus coming for you! Drive, drive!"
16899,"Okay, guys. Get ready! We're just seconds away!"
16900,"Goodbye, stupid Earth!"
16901,Huh. My watch must be running fast. Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
16902,Wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
16903,Wait for it... wait for it...
16904,Please don't go! Please? Please? I command you!
16905,"Lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?"
16906,"Aw, that's my girl."
16907,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Let's go to Moe's. We'll walk and punch.
16908,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Huh?
16909,"Moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?"
16910,"Hey, you with the tempura -- your arm broken?"
16911,"...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?! Twelve apostles... but Jesus was at the last supper too! This changes everything."
16912,"Multiply by seven... don't forget to carry the six, six, six..."
16913,"Wake up! The Rapture is coming in half an hour! There's no time to waste! Marge, grill a chicken! No, make sandwiches! And some Kettle Chips would be nice! Original, not barbecue!"
16914,Forget school! We have to get to the mesa!
16915,But my prediction says--
16916,Stupid family... won't even come to my Rapture... I went to Lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.
16917,Three... two... one...
16918,"Oh, I'm wrong again. I'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!"
16919,Woo hoo! I was right!
16920,And there's the Earth. So beautiful with your many rings.
16921,I'm comfortable like this.
16922,How come it's not open yet?
16923,Hm...
16924,Thanks. Listen... could you do me one more favor?
16925,"Oh, sorry, uh -- I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash."
16926,I could.
16927,"Wait! Before you go, there's one thing I gotta know. What happened to my family?"
16928,I've gotta save them.
16929,"Lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. Really top notch. But I can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering."
16930,"Oh, he'll be fine. And you could still spare my family by--"
16931,"Buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy."
16932,"Screw you, Dino! You squandered your gift!"
16933,Uh-oh.
16934,I'm sorry. But Heaven isn't Heaven without my family in it.
16935,"Just send me back to Earth, and put off this whole Rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so."
16936,Superman did it.
16937,"No, I'm in a good place with that."
16938,"Yeah, I'll definitely read those later."
16939,"Now listen, if you could just see your way clear to..."
16940,It was all just a dream.
16941,"But what are these wings? Oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back."
16942,"Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me..."
16943,"Thank you, Lord! It's back the way it was."
16944,Ah... this is heaven.
16945,"Prison overcrowding, I've got a solution for that. Oh my God! U-S-A! U-S-A!"
16946,"Free movie tickets?! I feel like Roger Ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!"
16947,She'll be fine here under the watchful eye of Grandma Shark Week.
16948,How about this guy?
16949,"Shut up, Flanders, I need a favor. Would you mind watching Maggie for a while? It would only be until later."
16950,"Come on Flanders, doesn't that ""Bible"" of yours say to ""love thy neighbor""? Why won't you love me?"
16951,"Thanks, Ned."
16952,You wear a bathing suit in the bathtub?
16953,Makes sense.
16954,"This theater sucks. My seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!"
16955,Yes.
16956,I've had enough -- I'm leaving!
16957,I'm stuck. Why did I eat that apple segment?
16958,"What are you kids laughing at? And if you say Jimmy Fallon, I'll know you're lying."
16959,Scantily-clad co-eds?
16960,Why you little... I'll teach you to have a libido!
16961,Wait'll I tell everyone about this! I'll feel important without drinking! That'll be weird.
16962,What a combination -- hot chicks and stupid Flanders.
16963,"Yep, and nobody's tellin' him. Not even his good buddy God."
16964,"Sensual, isn't it? And the best part is Stupid Flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. Hence my nickname, Stupid Flanders."
16965,"Hey Moses, are you a loser?"
16966,"Yes I am, Homer."
16967,"Son, I need to pee, but I can't stop watching. Fetch me a bottle."
16968,"Uh, we're watching the latest photos from Mars. Ho, great stuff. Worth every billion."
16969,Well that's obvious. He doesn't even know.
16970,"Uh, I'm thinking about getting a yogurt franchise. It's called ""Plops"" and..."
16971,"Okay. Flanders, you see..."
16972,"Ned, I had no choice. It was just so funny!"
16973,Mmm... soggy br--
16974,...ead.
16975,You're right. But you know who the real victim is here? Ned.
16976,Oh yeah.
16977,What's this? Goodbye Springfield...
16978,Last-diddily-ast? He's gone! And it's all someone's fault!
16979,"Don't worry, Marge. I've taken every precaution."
16980,"Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I live next door. So, is that your whistle?"
16981,"Um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, I want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all..."
16982,"Don't worry, I'll straighten things out with Coach Clay. We're good buddies. We play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" And he always lets me win!"
16983,"Hey Coach, do you mind turning down the music? My baby's trying to take a nap."
16984,Lookin' good... feel the burn...
16985,You're a god!... I can't think of any more!
16986,Go! Go! Go!
16987,"Hey, you knocked out my power. How am I supposed to eat without watching TV?"
16988,When are you gonna stop poking me? Will it be soon?
16989,But I siphoned that gas from Flanders! Flanders...
16990,Like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.
16991,"Oh, I was just driving around the mid-Atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and I just... oh, who am I fooling with my awesome lies? I want you to come back to Springfield."
16992,After the party.
16993,"No, I wanna make you a respecting stock. I don't know if you've noticed, but I've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years..."
16994,"Shut up, Flanders. But some things I could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit..."
16995,"...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. Oh, Ned, I don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?"
16996,I am a little pudgy. You got me. Yeah.
16997,I saw my advantage and I took it. That's what heroes do.
16998,"Okay, Ned. Get ready for your welcome home surprise."
16999,Maybe. We don't know that for sure.
17000,Go nuts.
17001,"Flanders. Okay, that's it. Really irritating!"
17002,"Boy, I can't believe you got expelled. Well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that's my thing!"
17003,"And if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the Army. Where you'll be sent straight to America's latest military quagmire. Where will it be? North Korea? Iran? Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge."
17004,"How can we afford any of these private schools? They're all so expensive. If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?"
17005,Get 'em from the smoke detector.
17006,The smoke will wake us up.
17007,"Catholic school, eh...?"
17008,"That'll straighten you out, boy. There, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to Hell!"
17009,Classic Grampa.
17010,"I didn't need that new fact! Now I forgot who won Bud Bowl Eight. Boy, I'm pulling you outta that crazy school!"
17011,"No meat?! What do they eat, light bulbs?"
17012,Bart! What the Hell are you saying?
17013,Mickey Mouse's dog?
17014,"Hey! I'm Bart Simpson's father, and I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! Hey, what's that smell?"
17015,You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!
17016,"Log Cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. Blessed art thou among syrups and..."
17017,"All pancakes aside, I really came here to talk about my son."
17018,Bingo? That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
17019,That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
17020,Bingo!
17021,You have to cheat.
17022,"Uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know..."
17023,"Celibacy?! I was talking about the meat on Friday thing. Man, you guys got more crazy rules than Blockbuster Video."
17024,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No matter what I did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?"
17025,"Okay, let's make some magic here. I wiped a booger on your shirt, I made a dog and a cat kiss, I swiped a bolted-down TV from a Holiday Inn..."
17026,"...I coveted the wife in ""Jaws 2,"" I lied to a waiter, I masturbated eight million times and I have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."
17027,"Woo hoo! I'm clean! In your face, Lord!"
17028,Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?
17029,Woo hoo!
17030,"Look, Marge, I know I was supposed to yell at that Priest, but he's so cool. He plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!"
17031,"Marge, no one is saying twelve. Nine, ten, tops. See..."
17032,"Marge, relax. I've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion."
17033,"Wow! Up here, that feels good!"
17034,Transubstantiation!
17035,"Welcome to the jungle, Kevin!"
17036,"Marge, what are you doing here?"
17037,"Marge, you bring Bart home now! Once you go Vatican, you can't go back again."
17038,"Face it, Marge -- Catholics rule. We've got Boston, South America, the good part of Ireland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!"
17039,Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?
17040,Bwa?
17041,"Hop in, boy! We'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt."
17042,C'mon Broncos... you can do it...
17043,"The Broncos won?! Why didn't I bet on them, like Professor Pigskin told me to?"
17044,He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
17045,Because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system.
17046,"I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the ""pick of the week"" has been right on the money."
17047,I have money!
17048,"A scam? Not according to ""Eddie F. from Tucson,"" or ""Football Millionaire in Beloit, Michigan."""
17049,...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.
17050,Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders but they look awful.
17051,"Hey, I didn't bet any of our money. I just borrowed some from him."
17052,"It's not my fault the Raiders lost, it's Professor Pigskin's!"
17053,But the pig!
17054,"Marge would kill me! Please, there's gotta be something else I can do. Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. I can't do it next week."
17055,"All right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house."
17056,They're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow. How am I gonna get rid of Marge and the kids?
17057,"Thanks, Moe!"
17058,"It got your hopes up, didn't it?"
17059,I swear.
17060,Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.
17061,"Guys, get out of here!"
17062,"Look, if you promise never to tell her, I'll let you be in the movie."
17063,Are you guys almost done?
17064,"Um... you're in the wrong house, lady."
17065,"Honey, please, just listen to what I have to say."
17066,I owed the mafia money...
17067,Where are you going?
17068,When will you be back?
17069,Who's gonna watch the kids?
17070,Me? But I'm the father.
17071,"Honey, come back! You didn't say bye to the kids!"
17072,"Well, we'd better go eat that yogurt."
17073,"Kids, I'm sure your mother will be back soon."
17074,"Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles."
17075,"You mean ""Homer's famous marinara sauce."""
17076,Where's your sense of magic and wonder?
17077,"C'mon, Marge. When are you gonna call?"
17078,Let it ring. Play hard to get. That's hard enough!
17079,Oh-my-darling-I-love-you-please- forgive-me.
17080,Moe! What are you calling me for?
17081,"Well, what if Marge tries to call while I'm talking to you?"
17082,"Of course I have call waiting, you idiot! I just never learned how to use it!"
17083,Uh-oh. That might have broken the phone. I'd better call Moe.
17084,Moe! Will you get off the line!
17085,"Oh, Marge. What a pleasant surprise."
17086,"No, no. It's not gonna be like that, I swear."
17087,"Ew, lemon cream! You're goin' in the Marge pile. I mean I love you so much..."
17088,Hello? Marge? Where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?
17089,"Hello, Marge?"
17090,"Does the pizza guy take a check? If so, where do we keep the checks? And lastly, how do you write a check?"
17091,Gotta find your Mom. Gotta find your Mom.
17092,It was hard enough gettin' you in there. I'm not lettin' you out.
17093,Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?
17094,"Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. I have cousins near here. We'll stay with them."
17095,"Oh, the rubiest. Ooh look! A new restaurant chain!"
17096,We'll say it's all our birthdays!
17097,"I warned you he was an idiot. Well, all I need is some moonshine and someone playin' the har-mon-a-key, and I'm as happy as a pig in plop!"
17098,Don't laugh! They're doing the best they can.
17099,"Oh, just great. Things couldn't be better."
17100,"She, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner."
17101,"It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned."
17102,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to use the outhouse again."
17103,You lost that first game to hustle me!
17104,Marge?
17105,These are for you.
17106,"Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was really, really wrong. I'm sorry."
17107,"I love you, Marge."
17108,Wha...?!
17109,You're needed at home!
17110,You're needed at home!
17111,"Well, that's very reasonable."
17112,You stole my wife! I'll kill you!
17113,Wow. I can see why she loves you.
17114,You know everything.
17115,And what a man!
17116,"Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. Is Marge saving them or killing them?"
17117,"Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that."
17118,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
17119,"Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!"
17120,Rubes.
17121,Catch me if you can!
17122,Manatees -- defend!
17123,Poor dumb country mouse. Can't even count.
17124,"Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes..."
17125,"Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me."
17126,Woo hoo!
17127,"Hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed R and R?"
17128,Yes... but I've got a friend who owes me a solid.
17129,"Flanders, I can't listen to your crap before my coffee."
17130,Stupid best friend Flanders.
17131,Stamps? Those are for snail mail! Stamps rule! I mean suck!
17132,"I think they killed each other. You know, one of those murder-suicide deals."
17133,What man would want this now?!
17134,Two four six eight! I hate stamps! They aren't great!
17135,"Okay, how about this? Seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. Everyone forget that."
17136,"Look at the bright side, Marge. When I die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. That's multi-tasking."
17137,"Okay, just let me clear some space."
17138,"Hey, I love waking up drunk in the morning."
17139,"I, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter."
17140,There's a little plastic man in your hair and I'm trying to rescue him.
17141,No soldier left behind.
17142,"Lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you."
17143,I can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. Why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?
17144,"Lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as I have, consistency is something, something that, something I love you, Bart."
17145,I thought it was twenty.
17146,I can't believe you're making money off this!
17147,No one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
17148,Butter face.
17149,That's bull man.
17150,"Oh, and that Dr. Hibbert was so boring... ""Homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... Homer, we must discuss your test results... Homer, we've got to find you a donor..."" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
17151,Lisa!
17152,"You see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends."
17153,"Oh, and I spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run."
17154,"Exactly. Now, what has two ears but can't hear?"
17155,"Tragically, yes."
17156,"Okay, Marge. But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up."
17157,"Don't worry, he's not showin' up."
17158,"Boy, Lisa's room really is scary."
17159,"Finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house."
17160,You know that racecar bed I made him?
17161,The brakes are shot.
17162,"Learn to drive, boy!"
17163,Uh... this is all I could find.
17164,Why you very little...!
17165,Stationary camera.
17166,"Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake..."
17167,"Run, Marge! Start the car!"
17168,And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
17169,Lisa! Lisa!
17170,"Where's Lisa, boy? This book's gonna solve all her problems."
17171,"Although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents."
17172,"Marge, we owe her the truth!"
17173,"Lisa, honey, please wake up. If you do, I'll get you a new pony."
17174,Uh... this is still part of your dream. Dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
17175,I forgot to floss this morning!
17176,"Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep."
17177,"Aw, poor Maggie."
17178,"I know, and you did, and you're great."
17179,"Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?"
17180,You're better than that.
17181,Can't even go in my own kitchen... Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
17182,"Noooo! Bart, that's a really bad storage area!"
17183,"I dunno, maybe. Plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox."
17184,Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?
17185,So you want Maggie to infect your kids?
17186,And would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
17187,...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
17188,"Now featuring the Pox Box! Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Like any disease box, results may vary. Pox box!"
17189,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie!"
17190,"Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!"
17191,"Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends!"
17192,"Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach!"
17193,I have to do this for work.
17194,"Marge, what's happening to me?"
17195,I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.
17196,I'm so itchy!
17197,Oh yeah.
17198,Mmm... Homer-oats.
17199,"Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying."
17200,"Right... right... right... right... okay... right. I love you, bye!"
17201,"I just got fired. Better check the ""Want Ads."""
17202,"Ooh! ""Truck drivers needed in Iraq."""
17203,Trucks are like big cars.
17204,Okey-doke. And you are...
17205,Will she know what this is regarding?
17206,"That's ridiculous! No woman would want to have sex with that loser! And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff."
17207,This-this is Marge's bra. I bought it for her boobs!
17208,"Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?"
17209,"Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?"
17210,I repeat: did you sleep with Kirk?
17211,You're not saying no.
17212,I'm still not hearing no.
17213,"Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!"
17214,Gladly.
17215,I came to get my mail.
17216,"Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket!"
17217,I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.
17218,"Well, I'd better go."
17219,"You know the Four Seasons? Well, I'm experiencing them first hand, because I'm living in the park."
17220,"Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad."
17221,Where's my bucket?
17222,"Bart! We're all disappointed there's no potato salad! But for God's sake, don't jump!"
17223,"I'm a-comin', boy!"
17224,Why you little...
17225,Okay.
17226,Make it two kajillion.
17227,We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
17228,Of course I do. The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.
17229,I guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
17230,"Wow. A robot kid would be a blast. We can confuse him and make his head explode. ""This statement is a lie. But if it's a lie then it must be true. But if it's true, then it must be..."" Kaboom!"
17231,"Now, I'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. Do you think I could..."
17232,Why you metal...!
17233,"Wow, the windpipe is incredibly responsive!"
17234,And he's great with the neighbors.
17235,"Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!"
17236,"David, you're by far the best son I've ever had. Uh-oh."
17237,Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.
17238,"Here, make me a kitty!"
17239,"Lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. In the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the American dream."
17240,"I'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. I hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us."
17241,"The sad part is, there were times when I actually had feelings for you. I almost felt I was your father."
17242,"David feels, and your mother will agree when I tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it."
17243,No toys!
17244,"Heyyy, it's Bart! Super!"
17245,You wanted to believe the lie!
17246,Those were my good pants.
17247,This stinks! I've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
17248,Woo hoo!
17249,Suckers.
17250,"Honey, animals don't feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus."
17251,They look a little green.
17252,Yes I am! I mean...
17253,Oh no! I've been killed!
17254,Outfoxed 'im with the corpse of my best friend. Hee-hee.
17255,Marge! You saved me.
17256,What was that for?
17257,"Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions."
17258,"Well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?"
17259,Marge isn't home.
17260,Dammit!
17261,"They'll bounce back, son. They're a strong people."
17262,Ooh! Ooh! I wanna ride the bumper cars!
17263,I call the red one!
17264,A strongman? Are you for sale? 'Cause I need someone to throw a birdbath at my neighbor.
17265,Hmmm. I suppose I could use a little toning.
17266,I'll give you five dollars for it.
17267,"Marge, I don't hate your mother. I just won't be sad when she dies. Forty-seven, forty-eight..."
17268,"Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana..."
17269,You want me to ride a whatsickle built for who?
17270,But I'm watching television. A lot of people worked hard on this show!
17271,"Three hundred and six, three hundred and seven..."
17272,Woo hoo! Pizza for breakfast!
17273,"Hello, Domino's? What do you mean, you're not open? No, you call me back during business hours! I'll show you who's a recorded message!"
17274,"Hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?"
17275,Just liftin' this dumbbell.
17276,Forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!
17277,"I'm pretty happy with this baby, now it's lefty's turn."
17278,"Wha? Hey, you..."
17279,"Excuse me, Mr. Bartender sir, may I have a sugar-free ginger ale? And uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds."
17280,I'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!
17281,"Negatively, I assume."
17282,"Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore!"
17283,Okay.
17284,I can't believe Marge hasn't called me. Maybe I should go home.
17285,Did she say anything else?
17286,"Oh Marge, I love her so much."
17287,He looks tough.
17288,I can relate. I've fought that foe and lost many times.
17289,"Moe, I'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing I barely liked in the first place."
17290,"Sorry, Moe. The place for my arm is around my wife."
17291,SWEET HOME ALABAMA...
17292,"LORD, I'M COMING HOME TO YOU / Alabama!"
17293,"Marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world."
17294,I was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. Now let's go to bed.
17295,That song is a pop music footnote! I didn't say stop!
17296,'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY...
17297,"Kids, this is the holiest night of the year. Tomorrow is Father's Day, and that makes tonight Father's Day Eve."
17298,"JOY TO THE WORLD, A FATHER'S BORN / LET ME RECEIVE GREAT GIFTS!"
17299,No Father's Day Eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... Daddy Claus?
17300,Is there a Super Bowl Bunny?
17301,"Oh, can I come with you? I know I can't."
17302,What a great Father's Day!
17303,A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.
17304,"Fear not, m'lady! Captain Dash Superstud is here with his small tool!"
17305,"Bart, this is the greatest present I ever received. To open another gift now would be like following the London Philharmonic with Jessica Simpson. Whatchu got, Lisa?"
17306,What the Hell is this?
17307,"Oh, it's heartfelt. There's no escaping that. Thanks, honey."
17308,"No, no, no, it's great. I'm done with it now."
17309,"Aw, isn't that cute?"
17310,It's not my fault! Lousy magnet.
17311,"""Happy Birthday Dad, From Lisa."""
17312,I still don't understand how her feelings can be hurt. It's my day.
17313,"Yeah, but I know how to win women back. I even won you back after I lost our wedding album in a bar bet."
17314,I mean I will win you back.
17315,"I'm sorry I made you feel bad, honey. But I'm gonna show you just how much I care about your feelings. One adult and one baby, please."
17316,Her first words! Play along. It's fifty cents less for babies!
17317,How you doin'? So... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?
17318,Does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
17319,"Oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. It's a little harder to shut up."
17320,"Oh, I know! But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?"
17321,I don't know. What happened to the last Safety Salamander?
17322,I can do that!
17323,"Okay, Lisa. Time for Daddy's big surprise!"
17324,"Sometimes it's scary when your dreams come true, isn't it, sweetie?"
17325,"Yeah. Now, I'm off to bring safety to Springfield Elementary and win back your love!"
17326,"What's that, honey? I can't hear you very well!"
17327,Salamander awayyy!
17328,"Sorry, Bart!"
17329,The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.
17330,Then what protects you if we crash?
17331,Stop this bus!
17332,"Look, Lisa. I made safety happen!"
17333,Safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.
17334,Son-of-a... Questions? Comments?
17335,"Did I hear ""where are the fireworks?"" 'Cause heeere they are!"
17336,Every man for himself! Trample if you must!
17337,Safety... safety... die for safety.
17338,"So, sweetie, am I your hero again?"
17339,"Now honey, you know Daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore."
17340,But I'll never stop trying to redeem myself in your eyes.
17341,I don't know.
17342,This looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!
17343,"No, she's not."
17344,Only three?
17345,That's more like it!
17346,"Please, you're embarrassing me."
17347,What can I do? I'm only one man.
17348,Are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? I read an email that said there was.
17349,Hmmm. I will run for Mayor!
17350,And I'll find out what a Mayor does!
17351,"Expand my brain, learning juice!"
17352,"Oh, I hate press conferences."
17353,"Marge, without this outfit, I'm just Homer Simpson, multiple felon. With it, I'm a costumed hero like George Washington or Dame Edna."
17354,"Today marks a new dawn for Springfield. This salamander is sitting on eggs labeled ""elder care"", ""flex-time,"" and ""downtown pedestrian mall."" And those eggs are ready to hatch!"
17355,"Now, I will take your questions."
17356,"Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls."
17357,"Bloop, bloop, bloop. Bloop, bloop, bloop."
17358,Why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?
17359,"Now, restaurant matchbooks for everyone!"
17360,"Hey, people may not love Homer Simpson, but they love this suit. Just like they love their stupid American flag."
17361,It's the smell of impending victory.
17362,A little.
17363,"No, but I swam in it."
17364,But aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
17365,That's weird. He started off as an egg.
17366,"That's an excellent question, Kent. First of all..."
17367,What the? It must have shrunk when my wife washed it!
17368,"That's right, I am a man! The man who dressed like a salamander to win back his daughter's love. Let's meet her now."
17369,"Uh, well, my son is here too. Let's meet him now."
17370,"Please, stop throwing fruit!"
17371,"Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?"
17372,I can't believe I lost after Ben Affleck campaigned day and night for me.
17373,"Whups, be careful of my tail."
17374,I still feel it. It's so itchy. Itchy...
17375,"Hey! Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! Whoops, wrong one."
17376,"I'll take that... Too slow, Drooly Joe... Peek-a-boo! I steal from you!"
17377,Silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!
17378,"You're like all Easter Bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! Maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. Oh, hey Marge."
17379,"Ladies. Marge, is there a small rip in my pants?"
17380,We throw those out anyway.
17381,"Hey, good looking. Wanna snuggle with ""Tyrannosaurus Sex""?"
17382,"Oh, come on, honey, you have lots of friends. There's, uh... Lisa and...the stove."
17383,"Oh, that poor woman. I am gonna find her a friend! Someone cute, athletic, with a nice laugh."
17384,It's a risk I'll have to take.
17385,"Son, I need to find a new friend for your mother. So you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself."
17386,I wish. I made these at work.
17387,Hmmm. I bet she'd be a good friend for Marge. She looks defeated too!
17388,Psst. Psst!
17389,"Hey Marge, where you goin'?"
17390,Why does every woman I try to talk to run into cans?
17391,"Marge, I did it! I found a woman to be your new friend! She's waiting in the living room!"
17392,I bet you can't throw a cat over the house.
17393,Huh. I was wrong.
17394,"Marge... in a gang? What're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? Seriously, I would love that."
17395,"Wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""Peterson's Field Guide to Birds"" on the kitchen counter?"
17396,Roadrunners are real!
17397,"Now, let's see what Marge is up to. ""Recipes,"" ""dress patterns,"" ""toaster undercoating agreement""... ""Heist plans""!"
17398,Burns' Mansion?! That's Mr. Burns' mansion!
17399,I gotta stop Marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.
17400,"Marge, I wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! Game over, man! Game over! So, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?"
17401,I'm not!
17402,"Oh, well... I try to have a good time."
17403,And tell me I'm not fat.
17404,"Listen, Marge. No matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul."
17405,"And Marge, there are certain things I can do for you that no other friend can. Special things."
17406,"BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP..."
17407,"BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP... BOMP, BOMP, BOMP, BOMP..."
17408,"DO, DO, DO DO / DO, DOOO..."
17409,"Charge! I mean, yes sir?!"
17410,A Lamborgotti Fasterossa? That's the car I think about when I make love to my wife.
17411,You're sending me to Italy?
17412,Can I take my family?!
17413,Do I have to hang out with them?
17414,"Hey, that guy in first class is taking a TV out of his armrest."
17415,What's in you?
17416,A buncha stupid cables.
17417,That flag is mine! Don't mess with Texas!
17418,"Shock and Awe, losers! Shock and Awe!"
17419,"Now we have to drive it straight to Rome, where it'll be shipped to Mr. Burns in Springfield."
17420,Marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?
17421,Why you little...
17422,"Wow! I've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here."
17423,A McDonald's where you can get booze!
17424,"Eh, there's a picture of it on my cup."
17425,Savages.
17426,Let me check the navigation system...
17427,It says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.
17428,I get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
17429,Don't worry. We got the cheese insurance.
17430,Nooooo!
17431,"Stupid Italy... wish you'd never been unified by Victor Emmanuel the Second... if only you'd stayed a loose confederation of city-states, trading with each other and occasionally warring."
17432,"Hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?"
17433,It's a Lamborgotti Fasterosa XT 550 with ABS Sport Tech package.
17434,Americano? What the Hell could that mean? Why can't you people learn to speak my language? I learned to eat your food!
17435,I honor you and your country.
17436,"Yes, tell us your story. But it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. And you'd better make us root for the protagonist."
17437,"Okay, so far I'm rootin' for ya."
17438,Holy moley!
17439,"I always thought you were, you know, ""out loud and proud."""
17440,"Yeah, I never went to college."
17441,"Yeah, I tell Marge everything! Not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such."
17442,"All right, Bob. We won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car."
17443,I thought I was doing Donald Trump.
17444,Prego?
17445,"I love you, Marge."
17446,Sideshow Bob!
17447,"It's called a hangover, sweetie. And it's an unavoidable part of life."
17448,"Mr. Burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties."
17449,What am I supposed to use it for -- transporting water to distant urban centers?!
17450,Uh-oh.
17451,Lazy Romans.
17452,Everyone remember where we parked.
17453,Opera? They have that here too?
17454,Can I be the Phantom of the Opera?
17455,But I do a great impression of him.
17456,"I am the gayest super-villain ever! Beware my scented candles! Oooooo, scented!"
17457,It's so beautiful...
17458,"I know, and he's magic!"
17459,"Hey, knock it off."
17460,Maybe he's cheating on us with the Episcopalians.
17461,"Look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky Eucharist. I wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font."
17462,Did anyone order a hero?
17463,"Okay, Christmas, Christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a Christmas card with his home address on it? What's up with that?"
17464,No tip till they bring back Hagar the Horrible!
17465,"Oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... I'd like to tell you all a little story I call ""The First Christmas."""
17466,A carpenter named Joseph was about to get some frankly preposterous news...
17467,And did you know that little Baby Jesus grew up to be... Jesus?
17468,"I know, it's weird, isn't it?"
17469,My God... it's over... We're free!
17470,I said we're free!
17471,I hope I never hear that God-awful nutcracker music again.
17472,I TOLD GRAMPA WE'D BE AWAY
17473,That's great! Now I'll just get my present for you. Which is... right outside the door.
17474,"Oh my God, I forgot to get Marge a present!"
17475,"I NEED A PRESENT FOR MY WIFE / OR I'LL HAVE NO SEX FOR LIFE / DIAMOND RING, A VASE BY MING / SOME KINDA USEFUL KITCHEN THING"
17476,I NEED A STORE I CAN BREAK INTO
17477,OR A PLACE RUN BY A HINDU!
17478,"Oh, it's just what I wanted. Here, Marge, this is for you."
17479,I don't care what that letter said. This man raised me single-handedly. When I think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he...
17480,"Lifeguard, huh?"
17481,"So this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""M"". Moleman? Mr. Burns? M. Night Shyamalan? That would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!"
17482,The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
17483,"There's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""M""!"
17484,Mason Fairbanks...
17485,His hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!
17486,"Okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. Oh, that sounds hard. Just do it!"
17487,"Uh yes, I'm a reporter with the local paper. I'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?"
17488,Interesting. Interesting.
17489,"So, I infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake."
17490,"Oh, that is so cool! Ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!"
17491,"So, you don't have any shrunken heads?"
17492,"That is small, right?"
17493,"Uh... you know it's a boat, right?"
17494,I'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.
17495,No... I said I work for a radio station. Nine-eighty on the AM dial but number one with our viewers!
17496,Uh... well I... I think you're my pappy!
17497,"I found this letter you wrote to my Mom, Mona Simpson."
17498,Possible Daddy!
17499,I'm sorry... I got a little carried away there.
17500,"Marge, I found my real father! His name is Mason Fairbanks, he has a knife just for cheese, and he talks like this ""Homer, please do that in the loo."""
17501,"Hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on Daddy's boat!"
17502,"Wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?"
17503,"Listen, old-timer, I'd like you to meet Mason Fairbanks."
17504,"Mason, come see my room!"
17505,Who's Mason Fairbanks?
17506,Woo hoo!
17507,And my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
17508,"Ha-ha! That's what you get for being luminous, jerks!"
17509,"Hey guys, we found the treasure! When I get to shore, I'm bringin' it right to the bar."
17510,"Oh, which way did Mason go? That must be him over there."
17511,What do I do? What do I do?
17512,Daddy... daddy...
17513,I drew this picture of you.
17514,That is so sweet.
17515,Dad...
17516,Wait. Can we have a moment in private?
17517,"As I lay dying on the ocean floor, I remembered everything you've done for me. To Hell with that stupid DNA test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and I love you."
17518,But how?
17519,Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
17520,"Aw, Dad."
17521,"Now, why don't you stay for dinner."
17522,Send up two hams!
17523,"Hey, this one's cold!"
17524,Listen... I wanted to ask if you could do something my former father never did for me.
17525,Teach me that the stove is hot.
17526,But I'm not tired!
17527,You made that TV show really mad.
17528,"Hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. It's the perfect thing to straighten you out."
17529,"Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then I'll be back to go to Vegas!"
17530,"Boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system."
17531,I don't tell your mother how much I've lost.
17532,One child to Portland! He's your problem now.
17533,"Why, there must be some mistake."
17534,"Oh yeah?! You're going to that camp, 'cause I'm gonna drive you there."
17535,Stupid Bart... makes me drive to Oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of Matt Groening ...
17536,You mean Fun Homer? I'm afraid Serious Homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
17537,It's no use.
17538,Eh.
17539,"Boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act."
17540,"At least you have something you're good at. I'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and I'm one Snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. Mmm, Snickers pie."
17541,"So, I see you're also traveling with your son. What boy prison are you taking him to?"
17542,"See Bart, I told you things could be worse."
17543,"Look at me, I use a napkin."
17544,"I bet they're from Massachusetts. You know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son."
17545,"Don't forget to wash your hands, Shakespeare."
17546,"Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special."
17547,"Uh, but could you add a bacon nose? Plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body."
17548,Fine. But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
17549,You know who would really like this place? Bart. Wait a minute... where the hell is Bart?
17550,You little monster! Show your face this minute!
17551,"Bart, where are you?!"
17552,Why you little...
17553,I'm stuck!
17554,Ow! Someone's hitting my butt with something!
17555,"Leave your ass, Homer. Leave your ass."
17556,"So Lenny, how's it goin' in Vegas? Pretty boring, I'll bet."
17557,"I've got you now, boy."
17558,Boy! Push down on the bumper! Then I can back the car up and save myself.
17559,Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.
17560,I'll kill you! I'll kill your whole family!
17561,"Kidding! I'm kidding! We can do that, we have a special friendship."
17562,I'm gonna double kill you! And then I'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. Then I'll dig you up and kill you again! That's the beauty of a shallow grave.
17563,"You sweet little angel. Oh, I'm gonna rip your head off. And spit down your adorable little neck. Because I wanna smash your little stupid head. Oh, but I love you we'll go on a fishing trip. But first I'm gonna put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out. That's what I'm gonna do!"
17564,"Well boy, you made the right choice. I think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us."
17565,"I don't enjoy it. Being a father is just a job. Long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!"
17566,"Hey, I enjoy you plenty."
17567,Talking time is over.
17568,"Thank you, Colonel."
17569,Woo hoo! Vegas here I come!
17570,I miss Bart! I can't leave him in that awful camp!
17571,"I'm comin', boy!"
17572,I bet this looks cool from overhead though.
17573,"Woo hoo! Vegas here I come! Oh right, Bart."
17574,Stupid horse! It's a deer crossing!
17575,"Wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!"
17576,"Son, I'm doing something I should have done a long time ago... taking you to Vegas!"
17577,And don't you try to stop us.
17578,"Uh, normal wear and tear."
17579,Try this one...
17580,"Uh, Marge. Me and Bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss, and now we're in Nevada State Prison. Also, I don't know where Bart is. If you see him, say ""hey."""
17581,"Marge, I ripped my pants! The only pants that understand my complex hiney."
17582,Ow! My ass!
17583,I paid for fifty laps and I'm gonna take them!
17584,I'll have to go to every store in the pants district to find another pair like these.
17585,"OH, WOULDN'T IT BE ADEQUATE?"
17586,"Mr. Stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if I whipped up public interest for them?"
17587,"Through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, I haven't even thought of it yet."
17588,How long is this commercial anyway?
17589,Huh?
17590,"It's called ""headvertising."" It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media."
17591,It's not supposed to.
17592,BLUE PANTS! BLUE PANTS!
17593,Fine.
17594,I'M GETTING BLUE PANTS IN THE MORNING / DING DONG THE ZIPPER'S GONNA SHINE...
17595,"Well, it did its job. Everyone's wearing blue pants now."
17596,"Earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. Except the Maine potatoes one. It's just a reminder to myself."
17597,Silly Indians. Our God made their god.
17598,I'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
17599,"Save me, Tsisnajini!"
17600,I'm stuck! And I have to pee. Now I'm just stuck.
17601,Why you little...!
17602,"Don't leave me! I hate to be alone! Except when I'm watching TV, then leave me alone. But right now, don't leave!"
17603,Will you tell me a story?
17604,No unicorns.
17605,"Wait, wait, wait, wait..."
17606,Now you're telling me Burns's story?
17607,Huh?
17608,Gotcha.
17609,I'm bald!
17610,"Hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. Like this!"
17611,I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!
17612,"Sure! You're gonna be all ""I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!"""
17613,Moe has a cappuccino machine??!!
17614,"Boy, come here and listen to Lisa's story. It's about Moe's treasure!"
17615,"Hey Moe! Thanks to you, I've been sober a week!"
17616,You didn't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole.
17617,"Well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs!"
17618,"Oh, why did I lead you down here to find those stupid coins?"
17619,"Well, I guess I should explain. Not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so I was out in the forest, hiding."
17620,I deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave.
17621,I figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. Money which we could use to pay for Bart's operation.
17622,That's a story for another day.
17623,I realized I could never find the gold without your help. So I made it this week's family outing.
17624,It's a lot of little stuff. God has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave Saturn?
17625,"Don't worry, Marge. Me and ""Terrible Two"" here are gonna win that computer for you."
17626,'Cause he wants it.
17627,"Now to begin ""Operation: Slight Edge""."
17628,I'm winning!
17629,"He's headed for the old mill. No, Cheatie, no!"
17630,So many paddles.
17631,Protect the duck! Protect the duck! Produck the tect!
17632,"Hey, this race is for rubber ducks, not meat ducks!"
17633,Woo hoo! I won!
17634,A living duck! I wished too hard and he became real!
17635,Hey... that's the same thing you said to Bart after he choked in that soccer game. And we both know he sucked.
17636,Just put it in the trunk and leave.
17637,A canoe made of country ham? You know I'll eat it.
17638,I heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
17639,"So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
17640,Don't pressure me. I get enough of that from my Dad.
17641,Old Man Flanders!
17642,Springfield High football rules!
17643,"No one turn on the sprinklers, okay?"
17644,Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.
17645,"Old showbiz animals, eh? Do you think any of the gremlins from the ""Gremlins"" movie are there?"
17646,I am gonna get them so wet.
17647,Sad? You're crazy. I feel like I'm at the Oscars for the animals I forgot existed.
17648,My son's been ape-napped!
17649,Aren't you gonna do something?
17650,But she'll leave the rest of him alone?
17651,"Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume I let something terrible happen."
17652,"I know what you think: when stupid Homer wasn't looking, Bart got kidnapped by a monkey."
17653,"And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later I can say that I already told you."
17654,"Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!"
17655,Bart! Bart!
17656,"When the monkey falls asleep, I'll sneak you out in this trash bag. Then I'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze."
17657,I fell asleep before the monkey.
17658,Uh-oh.
17659,"Hey Monkey, eat tranquilizer dart!"
17660,"Lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. If they did, then my experiments could be called cruel."
17661,"Marge, Toot-Toot and her son escaped!"
17662,Mr. Teeny?!
17663,I am so stoked about Lenny's party. He said he's gonna make a surprise announcement!
17664,"Why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? I like your hat, sweetie."
17665,I mean the one at the house.
17666,Oh my God!
17667,How did Lenny get to be Newsfake Magazine's Man of the Year?
17668,What?! Next you'll be telling me he didn't meet Woody Woodpecker!
17669,"Lenny, this TV is amazing. If you're not careful, I might just spend the rest of my life on your couch."
17670,"You're right, Lenny. I..."
17671,Lenny! Bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! Chop-chop!
17672,Look at that picture quality -- you can see the soulless emptiness in that shark's eyes.
17673,"Ooo, ""Two and a Half Men!"" You can see the soulless emptiness in Charlie Sheen's eyes."
17674,"Later, if I have enough energy, we can walk up to the TV and I'll show you how thin it is."
17675,"Oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore."
17676,"Wow, I can actually feel the heat."
17677,Can you at least take a picture of me with the TV?
17678,"Oh yeah, good times."
17679,Stupid non-plasma TV. Picture so blurry. Might as well rub dirt in my eyes.
17680,Oh Marge! I love you! I love you! I love you!
17681,There's a chance we won't win?
17682,My collection is complete. Forty years of the Family Circus.
17683,Y'ello.
17684,The big screen TV?
17685,All expenses paid?
17686,"Hey, funny man, say something funny!"
17687,Don't lean out of the tra--
17688,"So, what's the prize on this wife swap show?"
17689,That's just the product I've been coveting! Pick us! Pick us!
17690,Are you kidding? Take a look at my DVD.
17691,They'll never let me near Lake Havasu again.
17692,I'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
17693,"Oh Marge, you're the greatest mom ever. I want the whole world to see that."
17694,"Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?"
17695,"Yeah, well I have full tenure."
17696,I'll bet the twist is he's gay.
17697,"Because we'll be on TV, and earn enough money to buy a TV. TV."
17698,"Yes, TV-sa?"
17699,"Listen up, Stonehenge. I made a drawing of the places on Marge you can't touch. Especially the hair."
17700,You take forever to say nothing.
17701,"Ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on Fox. Why'd you do it?"
17702,"I see. Well, I should be getting to the living room..."
17703,"Well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either."
17704,"Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football."
17705,I don't know why I ever married that woman.
17706,"Uh, okay."
17707,"There's this guy that got killed -- I think it was in Miami? So C.S.I. Miami investiga-ted-ed it. Then a family said how much they loved the Olive Garden. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, Letterman was talking to Alias."
17708,What's that delicious smell?
17709,She's nowhere to be seen. Time to let Homer be Homer.
17710,"Oh Marge, thank God you're back! She made me spend time with the kids. And not just TV time. Talking time!"
17711,Maggie? She's in her crib.
17712,"So it would appear. However, Cousin It, there, was born a woman."
17713,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna vote ""No"" on Thirty-eight so you can't adopt."
17714,Kidding! Kidding! I don't vote! The polling place is up a hill and I never make it!
17715,YOU MAKE ME LAUGH / YOU MAKE ME CRY / WITHOUT YOU I'D JUST / WANT TO DIE / FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE / YOU'LL BE A FIXTURE / NOW LET ME ENJOY / YOUR PICTURE IN PICTURE...
17716,"And Marge, you're pretty great too."
17717,I thought it was about her boobs.
17718,"Tonight on Jock Center: a slugger on 'roids, Tiger Woods is annoyed, and North Korean missiles deployed!"
17719,"I've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'. I, Homer Simpson, will personally bring the new pro football franchise to Springfield."
17720,"God, we have fun."
17721,I'll show you all. I'm gonna spearhead the hell out of this expansion bid!
17722,"Marge, meet pro football's newest team: the Springfield Meltdowns!"
17723,Plus I designed a state-of-the-art stadium. We'll fund it with corporate naming rights. It's the Duff Beer-Krustyburger-Buzz Cola-Costington's Department Store-Kwik-E-Mart-Stupid Flanders Park!
17724,So... Homer do good?
17725,Maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.
17726,You mean...
17727,You're a useless old man! Name one thing you do for this family.
17728,"Yeah, you're right."
17729,"Y'ello. You want my opinion on current movies?! Well, first of all, they're all perfect. Also: when's the Cap'n Crunch movie coming out? And will it be ""R"" or ""Hard R""?"
17730,"Lisa's right! It is a cool, super sport!"
17731,"Ooh, a penny. This is my lucky day."
17732,"Yep, my lucky day."
17733,Hurry up and kill it! I have to be at the opera by seven!
17734,I love it when Mr. Burns shows a movie at work.
17735,Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie! Mo-vie!
17736,"Woo hoo! I win! In your face, best friends!"
17737,"Hey, Marge it's what I've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury."
17738,"Oh my God, you're right! I'd better call the guy."
17739,"Send someone right over! Ooh, here he is."
17740,"Yeah, well while I'm gone, you'll do what he says."
17741,What about her.
17742,I'll miss you kids too.
17743,That's me!
17744,Woo hoo!
17745,A book?
17746,"Oh, the cereal's just a metaphor."
17747,"Thanks, sweetie. I've never been less angry to receive a book."
17748,"This isn't India! Where's the University of Notre Dame, the Indy 500, Wrigley Field, Dodger dogs --?"
17749,Oh no! I took a job on the other side of the world!
17750,"Oh, I hate this sub-continent."
17751,Lisa! It's me! I'm in trouble!
17752,A cow took my iPod and I punched it!
17753,"Uh-huh... Do I have to? Okay, okay, I'll show the cow I adore it."
17754,"Oh baby... ooo, did you lose weight?... oh c'mon, baby, don't play hard to milk..."
17755,"Okay, Apu said his cousin Kavi could help me out."
17756,"Let's see... Apu's cousin is medium height, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair..."
17757,Are you Kavi?
17758,Are you Kavi?
17759,Finally.
17760,Sorry I'm late. I was doing Carnak with my bodyguard.
17761,Hindu. What do you call the moisture on your Hin?
17762,"Uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... Did I say ""um""?"
17763,"Okay book, I didn't read you, and you didn't read me, but we're both in this together, so say something smart or get ready to run like hell. Um... ""In business as in breakfast, fried eggs have fragile yolks... huh, huh?"
17764,Just outsource it to Lisa. Outsourcing is the answer to everything.
17765,Outsourcing!
17766,"Well, a little book once told me..."
17767,...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.
17768,You're giving me absolute power?!
17769,I'm not a God. God has a white beard and invented the Da Vinci Code.
17770,"Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof."
17771,I won a free soda! I am a god!
17772,I am a God! I know all!
17773,"Silence! Now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant."
17774,Marge?
17775,It's... um... Jannnn... Febbbb... Marrr...
17776,May firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
17777,"Well, I'm just glad I'm not a god anymore. I wanna go home. How's Chief Wiggum?"
17778,"Yeah, he's funny."
17779,"I'm so bored, I figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats."
17780,"See, it goes: ship's wheel, Popeye tattoo, Gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel."
17781,My life's work ruined.
17782,"Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!"
17783,Hide me!
17784,"Please, you've gotta help me! If they find me they'll kill me."
17785,"Oh Lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me."
17786,"So, thou art a widow, eh?! Then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee."
17787,Oh baby...
17788,What kind of a booze cruise is this? Where's the hooch?
17789,"Stupid Flandish. Uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little Bible-thumping in the crow's nest? What do you say, Miss..."
17790,She's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
17791,Why thee little...
17792,May I escort you to the railing?
17793,Beer? I thought you guys didn't drink on the Gayflower.
17794,What-ever.
17795,"But baby, a man has needs."
17796,"People, this is madness! We can burn the witch later! Right now, I've got to save this ship!"
17797,"Hey, I've been driving drunk since I was twelve! But first...who's gonna help me pee?"
17798,"Don't worry, Marge. I'll see to it you fundamentalist Christians live to take over all America by the twenty-first century!"
17799,"Man, that bird did it all. Good guy."
17800,Land ho!
17801,I do!
17802,"Well, I guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. It takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: ""the nineteen seventies."""
17803,"My wig! I mean, my natural hair!"
17804,I've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
17805,Nooooo!
17806,"Catch me, Flanders!"
17807,Woo hoo! It's almost New Year's! Ten... nine... eight...
17808,...three... two... one... Happy New Year! My resolution is to be more fun!
17809,"Uh, gimme a second, I'm in the bathroom."
17810,What? I have great ass suction. Now how 'bout a little privacy?
17811,My keys!
17812,"All right, I can see this is all up to me."
17813,"Swim, fatty, swim!"
17814,Don't tell me what to do.
17815,"Oh my God, our boat is upside down!"
17816,Or will ever do.
17817,"Hey, it says here ""the book"" was written by Tom Stoppard. This isn't a book, it's a play! Book."
17818,"Hey, check it out, I'm Scratcher or something."
17819,They're gonna divide the school in two?
17820,"Well, you know what a man invented? Actual paper."
17821,Which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
17822,"Let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles..."
17823,"Pinball machines, the Renaissance..."
17824,"Oh, why did women invent sleeping on the couch?"
17825,"Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?"
17826,You seem cool. Wanna catch a movie?
17827,Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
17828,"So... do you wanna ""wang chung"" tonight?"
17829,"Well, uh... uh... Honey, you're just as smart as a man. Sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like I'm doing it with a dude."
17830,"Well, I won't be lonely. I can always cuddle with the dog."
17831,At least everyone knows I'm smarter than you.
17832,How did this happen?
17833,Screw you! I'm never gonna pay!
17834,"Fine! I'll finish it myself. And don't think I'm gonna screw it up, because I won't!"
17835,"But sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them."
17836,My work here is done.
17837,I'm needed at the door!
17838,"Seventy-four? Oh sorry, there's been a mistake."
17839,"On second thought, I am Brenda Wine cooler."
17840,"Son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly. Now, for once, I'm getting' rich-person mail. You wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?"
17841,"Okay Weingartens, what else is in your mail?"
17842,"Ooh! Marge, you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?"
17843,"Mark and Tracy, I remember the first words I heard you say: ""I do."""
17844,"Take that, liberal media."
17845,"Marge, I don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail."
17846,She's opening her eyes!
17847,She doesn't recognize us!
17848,You monster! What have you done to my face?!
17849,When will Marge remember us?
17850,Jogging?!
17851,Sweet!
17852,Jogging?
17853,"Marge, I'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia. I got you flowers a fluffy pillow...and a nice, relaxing private room."
17854,I'm your husband!
17855,I am! We're the same age!
17856,I do eat a lot of crap.
17857,"Great news, Marge -- we're goin' home."
17858,Why you little...
17859,"Yeah, but he's cool with it. Right?"
17860,Why you little...
17861,Now the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.
17862,"Those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."
17863,"See that ball of fire? That's the sun. It goes by many names: Apollo's Lantern, Day-moon, Old Blazey. The important thing is never to touch it."
17864,"Yes, now you do."
17865,I'd better get ready -- I'm next!
17866,"All right, Marge... time to remember Admiral Awesome!"
17867,Why do you remember them and not me?
17868,Okay. All it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.
17869,"Here's me fighting with former President Bush, me fighting with current President Bush, and here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss."
17870,"Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose."
17871,"When a man and a woman love each other very much, they--"
17872,But what if we...
17873,You used to love my non sequiturs!
17874,"Oh no, Bart and Lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!"
17875,"Marge, if I can't make you remember me, then I'll make you fall for me all over again."
17876,The heart is the symbol for love.
17877,So beautiful. I wish I could understand Italian.
17878,Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
17879,"It was in that plywood castle that we first... well, you know..."
17880,Oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.
17881,"No, it was the happiest night of my life! The warm Spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards... Don't you remember, darling?"
17882,"I know. Wait, I thought of another way: I stay!"
17883,"Marge, I realize you've made up your mind, and I want you to know that I deeply respect your boo!"
17884,I know. I just thought maybe... boo!
17885,Boo.
17886,"Well, the rest of your life for sure."
17887,That might be Marge!
17888,Marge?
17889,"I sure have, pardner."
17890,"Oh no! He's Marge's, and my, dream man! I've gotta make a play for her now or I might lose her forever!"
17891,At least she's found someone who can make her happy.
17892,You idiot!
17893,Do you know what you just gave up?!
17894,"The wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet."
17895,"You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. In ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. And you blew her off."
17896,Really? Well she's still great!
17897,I'm so happy we're together again. Wanna get a drink?
17898,"Uh, yeah. I started when you were in the hospital. I was so worried. Recently I tried this thing called ""beer."" And..."
17899,But do you also remember that you're an enabler?
17900,And her?
17901,And her.
17902,What about him?
17903,"Yeah, I have their baseball cards."
17904,Look at all those people. You know them?
17905,"Yeah, she's over in post now."
17906,"Not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with Richard Sakai."
17907,"Oh, he ain't gettin' married. He has commitment issues!"
17908,"When you get to third base, I'll buy ya a beer."
17909,All right. Just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
17910,Woo-hoo! Weapons!
17911,Don't start the exhibit without me!
17912,Look at that line.
17913,Time to do what I do best -- ruin it for everybody.
17914,"Hey, Flanders! Thanks for saving our place."
17915,"Aw dude, I was totally here. You calling me a liar? In front of my kids? 'Cause I'd take a bullet for you, man. Right in my mouth!"
17916,"Oh, no you don't!"
17917,I'm everywhere.
17918,"Wow, this 3-D is amazing! You can actually feel the vase!"
17919,"Sorry, Flanders. But when you get in, you can use my audio tour. Narrated by Melanie Griffith."
17920,Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
17921,My mind is always open to new ideas.
17922,Onions in the peas! What the hell?
17923,This is the break in the case we've been waiting for!
17924,Poor Bambi... poor Thumper...
17925,"I love it when you're not into it. Oh yeah, baby. Oh yeah that's it ignore me. I'm not even here."
17926,"Thanks, Marge. It's not a twist-off!"
17927,C'mon...
17928,C'mon! Open! I want what's in you!
17929,"You, stupid..."
17930,"Oh wait, it was a twist-off."
17931,Now you can only see butts on cable.
17932,The Isotopes are winning? To the bandwagon!
17933,Nothing beats a day at the ballpark with my family.
17934,"Tickets, tickets, who needs tickets?"
17935,"Don't worry, I'll use the money I make to buy tickets from a scalper. Then I'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! Rich! We did it, baby! We made it through the rain!"
17936,"Tickets, thirty dollars! Big game, everyone wants to see the game..."
17937,Cop! Act like you're in love with me.
17938,Bart! Hand me that sack of batteries!
17939,Nine Volt! Double A! D!-D!-D!-D! Cordless drill!
17940,Look at that ugly old man.
17941,Really? You'd kiss an ugly old man like me?
17942,"What a game! I got on the kiss-cam, I participated in ""the wave,"" and I got to pee in a trough! Marge, can we get a trough?"
17943,"Ooh, iced tea!"
17944,Buck Mitchell!
17945,"Yes, yes. The game you played so horribly at."
17946,Season tickets?! I could entertain business clients. I might even land the Henderson account!
17947,Sure. That means she wants to talk in private. It's probably about you.
17948,"Hey, we've gone through more hardships than the Jews and Charlie Brown put together."
17949,That's just how I feel.
17950,Buck Mitchell!
17951,Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.
17952,"Now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till I say so."
17953,"Wow, I think we've really hit on something here. Unfortunately, we're out of time. How does that make you feel?"
17954,"Shut up, my ten o'clock's here."
17955,"Interesting, interesting...."
17956,"Buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own Marge."
17957,"Good idea, honey. Buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?"
17958,Just sign your name above President Lincoln's.
17959,And I say a monkey can mow our lawn!
17960,I stole a rack of fur coats. I sell one a year to pay for Christmas.
17961,"Why, 'cause I'm fat?"
17962,Like I always say: compromise is the key.
17963,Let's compromise and say nobody said it.
17964,"Hey Tabitha, great show. I like that part where you mentioned Springfield. Did you know that's where you are?"
17965,"Oh, you're so hot."
17966,If only I'd seen you before I met my wife.
17967,Don't tell the hamburger in my car.
17968,Okay.
17969,"So, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?"
17970,Oh yeah...
17971,Thank God I brought protection.
17972,I used to be so embarrassed buying these.
17973,"Oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock."
17974,Cancellations require twenty-four hours No-tice.
17975,"Yeah, they beat me up at work. Look at the word they wrote on my skull."
17976,I didn't want you to learn that word this way.
17977,"Marge, we've gotta get Buck and Tabitha back together. This is the most important case of our careers!"
17978,"Oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. Real fair. Class act."
17979,I'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. And I'll do it with or without you!
17980,But I wanted to do it with you.
17981,It's working! Buck's buying my fake message! And you said it would never work.
17982,Uh... she was here a minute ago. She must be pooping.
17983,Great. But enough of the baseball analogies. They sicken me.
17984,"Now, m'lady, your carriage awaits."
17985,"Wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!"
17986,"He's talkin' like the guy in ""Fat Albert."" Howba areba youba?"
17987,Whyba youba doba thatba?
17988,"Mmm, this must be what angels taste like!"
17989,Why can't you do anything?
17990,"Dirt nap, eh? Hm..."
17991,"Sorry, Marge, can't hear ya!"
17992,This is all my daughter's fault. But I'll make it up to you. Bart and I will run your business till your Dad's okay.
17993,"Everything. And I learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""Shark Tale""."
17994,Leave him to me.
17995,Ow! I hurt my fist and my palm. I thought you guys were lookin' out for me.
17996,"All right, tap jockey, you owe Fat Tony fifty bucks. Cough it up!"
17997,Just get the money.
17998,"Okay. Take it, take it! Just don't hurt me!"
17999,"Okay pretty boy, where's Fat Tony's fifty bucks?"
18000,It'll do for now.
18001,"Uh, it fell off a truck. You know, a truck-truck."
18002,No problem. I'll be back in ten minutes.
18003,You monster! Just cut his Achilles tendon with this knife.
18004,But this is the only life I know!
18005,Can I still talk with my hands?
18006,What about with my ears?
18007,Lady. Man. Lady. Man. Lady.
18008,"Hey, if I poisoned them, would I be doing this?"
18009,"Marge, could you let it go? You won. She's dead!"
18010,"Yeah, put a leash on him, lady!"
18011,Spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! Just give us the pills. Clear-cut his brain down to the nub!
18012,"Thank you, Doctor. Marge?"
18013,I've never seen him happier.
18014,I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.
18015,"Transport yourself to the shores of Nova Scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--"
18016,"So it's a noise war he wants, huh? Then I'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!"
18017,And a circus fire!
18018,"Sleep tight, my angel!"
18019,What?!
18020,"Oh! Let me know when and if you want sex, honey!"
18021,"Boy, get dressed. You're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!"
18022,I'm sending you mixed messages! Now get the Hell outta here!
18023,I love you so much. Damn you!
18024,"Woo hoo! What's next? A contract with Groove-tone Records? Take the G-train, baby. Groove-tone!"
18025,"Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you."
18026,And then today at lunch Lenny and I went to the park and rented a rowboat. Carl sketched us from the bank. Summer days.
18027,And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?
18028,Beware of el Taco Belly!
18029,No mas! No mas!
18030,"Not if I can help it, Lisa!"
18031,"Uh, no. sorry if it sounded like I did."
18032,I guess.
18033,Deal!
18034,"Ooh, gummy worms!"
18035,Don't tell me how many times to think!
18036,Then stand back!
18037,This doesn't taste like I thought it would.
18038,We already own a book!
18039,"Cool, a carpenter's library!"
18040,"This doesn't look easy, but I'll bet it is."
18041,"Oh yeah? Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah..."
18042,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah..."
18043,"Okay, now you do me."
18044,I did! I made a foot rest.
18045,What's the point? We're all slowly dying.
18046,"You sure are, sweetie -- I love this bed you made."
18047,"Yep, it'll do that."
18048,Simpsons Manly-Man Handyman at your service.
18049,No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.
18050,"Marge, the coast is clear."
18051,"Oh, uh, that was me. You know that old saying: ""measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."""
18052,"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
18053,It's allll good.
18054,...Annnd done.
18055,Listen... what would you say if I told you a woman did most of the work?
18056,"Uh... Like all manly men, I have a vivid imagination."
18057,Mmm... extra-virgin...
18058,"Of course I can make a credenza, whatever that is. Just give all the details to my secretary Shirley."
18059,That Shirley is quite a gal. We should fix her up with Barney.
18060,"Marge, giving me credit was your idea. Now could you rub my butt? I sat on it so much it's a little sore."
18061,"Look, I'm sorry you're upset. But if we tell the truth now, I'll be humiliated in front of the whole town. Then you won't be married to a man. You'll be married to some kind of gay jellyfish, floating outside the Florida Keys, cruising for rich snorkelers. You don't want that."
18062,He wants to grind his own corn. Maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
18063,Switch!
18064,"Who'd you think would help me, my wife? Heh."
18065,"Yeah, I hear it too. Maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."""
18066,"...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, infinity. I never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town."
18067,"Look, I understand that you're mad. Which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old Springfield roller coaster."
18068,"By the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. If the kids ask, I did it."
18069,"Now as I see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."
18070,"We need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts."
18071,Hmm... let me mull that over.
18072,What are struts?
18073,I don't know anything about struts.
18074,And I promised these guys money I don't have! And they're gonna be so mad!
18075,Maybe I can sneak home without them seeing me.
18076,"Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?"
18077,"To Daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day."
18078,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, and out-of-town roller-coaster weirdoes."
18079,And now I give you... the Zoominator!
18080,And now to get stinking drunk!
18081,"Sure, I'll tell them the truth..."
18082,The truth is that I'm perfect and everything I touch is perfect!
18083,I've never felt saferrrr!
18084,Uh-oh. Oh. Why must we preserve America's historic roller coasters?
18085,Thank you honey!
18086,Everyone! My stupid male pride made me lie to you. Everything I claiiimed I did was actually built by Maaarge!
18087,Avenge me!
18088,"Marge, I realized something when I was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. I'm just glad I have you as my safety bar."
18089,"Hey, that's great. Let's look at it after."
18090,You always find an excuse not to make out.
18091,"Ooh, a space marshmallow!"
18092,Where do you think you're going?
18093,"If he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?"
18094,"Marge, I ate it, it's over."
18095,Oh no you don't!
18096,If I can keep down Arby's I can keep down you!
18097,"Must eat, then poop, then eat some more, then eat while pooping."
18098,Still hungry.
18099,Son! Let me have a lick at you.
18100,"Nag, nag, nag."
18101,"Uh, no. Just gas."
18102,"Ooh, teenagers... No! Today's teens have enough problems, without me eating them."
18103,I'll savor you!
18104,No.
18105,Beer-battered Germans...
18106,Must eat more fat people. Thank God I'm in America!
18107,I used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.
18108,Dr. Phil McGraw!
18109,"You're right. Starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner."
18110,"That's ridiculous, talking fudge."
18111,Marge! I missed you! All this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.
18112,"Well, back to the drawing board."
18113,"What happened to ""for better or for worse?!"""
18114,It's amazing. He tastes just like Jeffrey Tambor.
18115,"Marge, to keep you in my life, I'd do anything. There must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community."
18116,"Bart, there's something I have to tell you father to son. I passed out on your turtle and killed it. Someday you'll thank me."
18117,"Hey, Milhouse."
18118,What's goin' on?
18119,"Hey boy, where's your mud buddy? I have a little job for him."
18120,"Yeah, get him a woman. That'll end his misery!"
18121,This hurts so much.
18122,Writing's for nerds.
18123,"Hey, I'm not done dancin'! This bulletin better swing!"
18124,Flanders?
18125,"So, it's a war of the worlds. Good thing we've got the sun on our side."
18126,"Go ahead and hide, you coward!"
18127,Burn everything!
18128,That's alien talk!
18129,I'm proud of what I achieved during my rioting.
18130,It was either kill him or kill no one!
18131,"Lisa, that was just a radio show."
18132,"Eh, big deal -- by the time Bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! We're China, right?"
18133,"Sorry, guys. You know, his mother's the one who made me come down here."
18134,Go on.
18135,Wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?
18136,Woo hoo! Where do I sign?
18137,Now where's my parade? Where's my parade?
18138,"Ooh, ""Who makes what in America."" Army private: fourteen thousand a year."
18139,I have to Marge. Who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?
18140,You? Don't make me laugh! You couldn't--
18141,"Aw, no, daddy's just teasing. Of course you could. You could keep it under a hundred. Yes, you could."
18142,No she couldn't.
18143,Are you gonna ask us our major malfunctions? 'Cause mine is I care too much.
18144,Snowflake?! What happens to me in the summer?
18145,I don't understand. How does punishing them teach me a lesson?
18146,"Man, you've got an awesome voice."
18147,"Can you say ""Side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?"""
18148,"Hm, sounded better in my head."
18149,Everyone got an assignment but us.
18150,I wonder what makes us so special.
18151,That's an odd way to start handing out medals.
18152,Are we that stupid?
18153,Nope. I'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!
18154,"Okay, these are war games and I'm head of my team. I have to think like a great military leader."
18155,I will!
18156,"Stay crunchy, men! Stay crunchy!"
18157,"Oh my God, I just remembered. It's Chinese New Year!"
18158,Gung hay fat choi! Gung hay fat choi!
18159,Americans!
18160,"Bring it on, chumps!"
18161,"Fingers, fingers, fingers!"
18162,"Moe, Moe, you gotta hide us from the Army!"
18163,"Not that Army, the one from ""Stripes!"""
18164,"Thanks, Moe. How can I ever repay you?"
18165,"Well, what have we got?"
18166,Rise my pretties! Find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!
18167,I'm not gonna surrender. You've seen what the U.S. Army does to prisoners. How would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?
18168,"Yeah, Marge always loves your cards. Well, you may not be the smartest guys in the Army..."
18169,"H means ""hot""?!"
18170,"Stupid Army, searching for me with that giant helicopter in the distance."
18171,Predator drone!
18172,Hmm... Let's see what your hangover has to say!
18173,"Dudes! Wanna make some extra spending money? Get a free pair of boots? Hey baby, you like obstacle courses?"
18174,"Thinking it over, huh? I'm cool with that."
18175,"Hey, pal. Like the way you handle that mop. You like killing? Hey, ladies. Are you tired of waiting for sanctions to work? I know I am."
18176,Hmm... I must be supposed to remember something.
18177,"C'mon, memory, wake up!"
18178,"Is it our anniversary? No, we don't have one this year. Hmmm..."
18179,Don't forge? Don't forge what?
18180,"Ohhh, don't forget. Don't forget what?!"
18181,The Senior Olympics? That's what I was supposed to remember?!
18182,Too late. The deed is done.
18183,This guy sucks. He can barely make it to the top.
18184,"Oh, I was supposed to take Moe fishing today! Everybody hide!"
18185,Says you.
18186,"Whoa, Marge, who'd you piss off?"
18187,"Moe, you live in a hotel? You're just like ""Eloise""!"
18188,This vibrating massage chair feels great!
18189,"Oooh, Moe's a poet! He has a soul! Flutter your wings! It's teatime in Buttercup Junction!"
18190,Moe's the Princess of Lollipop Land! He lunches on lavender and potpourri!
18191,"Seriously Moe, I think you have a gift."
18192,"Ooh, you love a man!"
18193,Do not mention that publication in this house! They never published my poem!
18194,"There once was a rapping tomato / That's right, I said rapping tomato / He rapped all day / From April to May / And also, guess what, it was me."
18195,"Ah, a family trip with the family bartender -- what could be better?"
18196,Lousy. I gotta go to Vermont for some stupid poetry thing.
18197,Fine. I'll drive between sips.
18198,"They got an open bar at this thing, right?"
18199,Wow. Troopers from every state in New England.
18200,It's gonna be awesome!
18201,"Man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses."
18202,"Hey, thanks for the heads-up! We'll see ya when we see ya!"
18203,I love these covered bridges. It's like driving through cute little houses.
18204,Oh I'm sorry. We should exchange insurance information. I have none.
18205,"And we went to the ""Vermont Teddy Bear"" factory. Look what we got! Hm? Hm?"
18206,"Oh honey, don't cry. They're not made from real bears -- just their fur and noses!"
18207,No one makes my daughter sob and run.
18208,"Make my daughter cry, will ya! Eat syrup, jerk!"
18209,"No, not now."
18210,"Hmmm... maple syrup. Sleigh on the label, very good."
18211,"Rich maple color, good swirl..."
18212,"Oh, Jemima!"
18213,I'm the king of goofing off!
18214,I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time-Waste.
18215,What'd I do?
18216,"Hey Marge, want a thousand dollars?"
18217,You're not ice cream... faker!
18218,Ice cream man! Wait!
18219,Ice cream man! Ice cream man!
18220,"One butter-crusted choco-rocket, please."
18221,"Yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. Change a hundred?"
18222,Nooooo!
18223,Max told you about me?
18224,This is the most fun I've ever had giving you wood.
18225,"Wait a minute. You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay..."
18226,"Why, doesn't he need it? Oh, right."
18227,Remember that crappy ice cream truck I bought?
18228,"Well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!"
18229,He was following my design.
18230,And now to get dressed in a most unusual way:
18231,Butter-brickle!
18232,You kids like ice cream?
18233,"What's the matter, son? Don't you have enough money for ice cream?"
18234,"Son, I will not stand for intolerance!"
18235,You give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. God bless America!
18236,"I said, God bless America!"
18237,Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!
18238,"Whoa Marge, for the first time in my life, I'm excited about going to work!"
18239,You're glad? You don't look glad. Are you sure you know what glad means?
18240,Love you!
18241,"Marge, I... Folk art!? That's my favorite kind of folk medium!"
18242,"Marge, you're a genius. You should make sculptures of other people! Like Lenny, or Carl, or the new James Bond. Will America accept a British James Bond? I can't wait to find out!"
18243,"Honey, I brought you more sticks."
18244,It's good to see you smile again. I was lonely being happy all by myself.
18245,Let me just put on some romantic music.
18246,"Hey, we got the whole night, baby -- let's slow things down."
18247,"Marge, everything looks wonderful!"
18248,"Well, I'm off to pedal my frosty wares!"
18249,"Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show."
18250,"I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. In cone-clusion, here's the scoop: I love you."
18251,"What the hell do you kids want? Oh right, ice cream."
18252,Oh my God! It's the opportunity of a lifetime!
18253,"Attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love."
18254,"Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream."
18255,Marge's show!
18256,Must jettison excess weight!
18257,"Oh my God, I've only got nine seconds till Marge's show!"
18258,I'll never make it! Unless...
18259,Woo hoo! I'm gonna be on time!
18260,"I made it back for your show, honey..."
18261,"Marge, let me explain: I had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families..."
18262,Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!
18263,Marge? Marge?
18264,"Honey, you've been in there all day. You gotta eat something. Why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? Lasagna would be awesome. Marge?"
18265,"Marge, I wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures I broke. Okay?"
18266,"Oh, I see. You'd prefer a wire transfer. What's your routing number?"
18267,"That's okay, I can get it from the bank, honey. I just need to know your birthday."
18268,"Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art."
18269,"If it would win you back, I would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. I hope it doesn't come to that. Could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?"
18270,"If you won't talk to me, I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down."
18271,"I'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs."
18272,Marge?
18273,Marge?
18274,"Marge, where are you? Did you change your name? Is it Kelly? Kelly!!!"
18275,"Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!"
18276,The world's not that interested!
18277,Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.
18278,"I just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?"
18279,Yeah? Well I wish I'd married Patty and Selma!
18280,You used to love it!
18281,Recording that fake fight was a great idea.
18282,"And, as always, have fun watching."
18283,GOOOO... LOVEMAKING!
18284,"And I hate the cutesy way you make Jack-o-lanterns! I like scary Halloween, not funny Halloween!"
18285,"Oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. But you still have to go."
18286,"Son, we all have to do things we don't want to. Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan! Just dancing around playing the pan flute! And here we are!"
18287,Too late.
18288,Yeah. How'd you afford this kick-ass party?
18289,Woo hoo! Marital sex!
18290,"Okay, tucked in tight, glass of water, nightlight on, no barn owls, don't do drugs, love you, good night."
18291,But your mother smells like coconut!
18292,"Okay sweetie, which book should I read?"
18293,"Oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. Broken, lonely grownups."
18294,Chapter One: The RubyStone in the Door-Portal. Are you asleep yet?
18295,Angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of Headmaster Greystash...
18296,"Lisa, wake up! They're taking Angelica to Mount Purgatorium."
18297,Tomorrow? But she's in trouble now! I'll just read ahead without you.
18298,"Oh, of course. Whatever you say, sweetie. Nighty-night."
18299,"Lisa, I'm home! Time for me to read to you!"
18300,"Lady, you're nice, but I'm married."
18301,Ow! I can't read ahead -- I promised Lisa I wouldn't!
18302,An Unexpected Occurrence?! What could it be?!
18303,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
18304,...As Headmaster Greystash fought a battle to the finish with dark wizard Maluicious Krubb.
18305,He killed Greystash!
18306,"Oh, Greystash. Greystash! Oh, hello, Lisa."
18307,Uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to Greystash?
18308,Angelica was trapped in the Suffoclock of Sandy Doom...
18309,Greystash looked Krubb right in the eye and said...
18310,The end.
18311,"Uh, they went to Star Wars Land and fought star wars."
18312,Now Lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
18313,Greystash! Greystash!
18314,Don't say his name! In your mouth it sounds like dirt!
18315,No man should outlive his fictional wizard! No man!
18316,"Just think, Lisa, if I had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!"
18317,Look out! It's the Grumple!
18318,"Give back that Holiday Cheer, you bastard!"
18319,"You're getting a cab, old man. In fact, I believe I see it now."
18320,Your present is leaving.
18321,"Marge, we have a problem here."
18322,Do you think that's the same Grumple from the ice show? Because I do.
18323,Why did you let that loser into our home?
18324,Christian Charity? What does a porn star have to do with this? He's gotta go!
18325,Really? Who's gonna make him?
18326,He sure has a lot of markers that don't work.
18327,"Don't worry, I make six of those a year."
18328,Lower the boom!
18329,Has the boom been lowered?
18330,We're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!
18331,"Oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors."
18332,"Marge, admit it -- you just can't say ""no"" to anyone. That's why you have three kids."
18333,Yes we are.
18334,"Marge, I have no idea what you were just thinking about. Why would you think I did?"
18335,"Yeah, but there's something else. There's this loser staying in our house. Marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does."
18336,"Well, I guess I'll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- You again?!"
18337,What the hell is this thing?
18338,"Those legs go on forever. Oh wait, they stop right there."
18339,A heart-shaped box of chocolates.
18340,"For your information, since I bought it I put on a ton of weight."
18341,Their drunken singing is ruining St. Patrick's day!
18342,Scottsdale? Will we stay at a Tripletree Resort?
18343,Then forget it!
18344,Gunderson!
18345,"And to think, he and I once shared a shower."
18346,"A hundred and seventeen degrees! Ooo, that reminds me."
18347,There's water under the seat!
18348,"Now remember, Marge, we're not buying anything for more than one-point-two. But if I scratch my nose, that means we can go to one-point-five."
18349,I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.
18350,I've never seen Marge like a DVD about a place so much. I'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her iPod.
18351,"Marge, I'm sorry I couldn't figure out how to get that movie onto your iPod... so I'm taking the family on a surprise vacation to Barnacle Bay!"
18352,We left plenty of food so you won't starve.
18353,I was talking to the cat!
18354,"Oh Marge, I'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate."
18355,You could caramel my arm...
18356,"I didn't say ""stop."""
18357,"It's not sugar, it's caramel!"
18358,I bet it was Bill Clinton's fault.
18359,Slick Willie wiggles out of another one.
18360,"Oh, I can't stand to see your mother unhappy. But this town could be great for your mother again. And I know three people who can make it happen."
18361,"Nice brush work, Emily. Nathaniel, you could learn a lot from her."
18362,"Oh Ma-arge, we have a surpri-ise! Come to the win-dow! And look down at the stre-et!"
18363,"Oh, they're getting a little exercise."
18364,"All night long, baby."
18365,"Blue pinwheel, red pinwheel, big white ball, wait for the ""aaahhh..."""
18366,"A green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:"
18367,"Oh, so, forming an angry mob, eh? Who we goin' after?"
18368,I think the hook is touching my brain. .
18369,Dammit!
18370,Queer strange or queer gay?
18371,How many yum-yum fish did we get?
18372,"Ew, it tastes terrible!"
18373,"Finally. Something even I wouldn't eat. Well, maybe a little more."
18374,Terrible.
18375,Here you go -- beer-battered shrimp.
18376,"Uh... I thought today was Opposite Day. By the way, you're very ugly. It's Opposite Day."
18377,So that means... it is Opposite Day.
18378,I don't know what to say.
18379,"Dear Marge, how are you? I am fine. The waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. And the salt water is rising. What's next? Pepper water? Ha ha. Love ya, Homer Simpson."
18380,Bart!? What the hell are you doing in there?!
18381,"Aw, son."
18382,"You did the right thing, boy."
18383,Watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!
18384,Yeahhhh!
18385,Shiiiii... pwreck!
18386,"Uh... sure we will, son. Right, Captain?"
18387,Should I hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?
18388,What's the code word?
18389,"Oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the Greeks called you Poseidon, the Romans... Aquaman. Look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again."
18390,Do you think your Mother will ever remarry?
18391,Why you little...
18392,The hell we are!
18393,"Well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly..."
18394,Oh my God! It's beautiful!
18395,Wait a minute. How am I breathing?
18396,Then when all seemed lost...
18397,I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!
18398,Then they brought us home...
18399,"So, that's our story. Oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. He turned out to be pretty cool."
18400,Ah! Nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.
18401,Which of the twenty-five easy-listening stations should we listen to?
18402,You're all idiots. I'm putting it on Chill Thunder Lite.
18403,Hey! Nobody cuts me off!
18404,How's it goin'?
18405,Then what's America doing in Iraq?
18406,May we? May we? Mais oui!
18407,"Treason?! But I love France! The way all our words are either a girl or a guy! Oh, that's the best!"
18408,I don't want the kids to see me this way!
18409,"I didn't write that! Even if I did love England, I'd play it cool. Wait for it to come to me."
18410,You moron! I'm already alive!
18411,"I shouldn't be here, I was framed!"
18412,Are you gonna torture me?
18413,Nine a.m.?!
18414,I swear revenge on Meaux! Even if it takes me the rest of my life! Can you loosen my arm so I can shake my fist?
18415,REVENGE! Okay.
18416,"Oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane."
18417,Now I have nothing.
18418,Where did you come from?
18419,"Oh sorry, I wasn't listening. I was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. Lookin' good."
18420,And decrepit.
18421,"Oooh, the the! But why are you helping me?"
18422,"So this map leads to a treasure, huh?"
18423,I wonder how long this tunnel...
18424,...iiiiiis!
18425,Mon Dieu! Weee!
18426,Ew! Silver!
18427,"Ooh, a penny!"
18428,This is my lucky day.
18429,"Madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen."
18430,"Monsieur Meaux, I would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening's entertainment."
18431,Here it is: The Harmless Chair of Relaxation!
18432,Little do you know that the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
18433,I have returned!
18434,Oh. Hold on.
18435,Oui oui! And I have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!
18436,"Yes, my love?"
18437,You guys liked him?
18438,"But Marge, I did it all for you!"
18439,"It takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! Plus, in the middle, I had to take revenge on some of my contractors."
18440,"Oh, right -- revenge!!"
18441,"I'm gonna get my revenge! And if I get caught, I'm pinning it on the baby like the time I shot Mr. Burns."
18442,"Is it ""The Count of Monte Cristo?"" 'Cause I love that story."
18443,Wow. That had what I really like in a story: an ending.
18444,"No, sweetie. The lesson is: never put down your weapon."
18445,Revenge!
18446,"This is it. It's taken all day, we've missed our flight to Hawaii, but finally, I'll get my revenge."
18447,You? You're too dumb to tell a story.
18448,"No, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it."
18449,"Parents who are still alive, I might add."
18450,You don't frighten me!
18451,Or my wife!
18452,Or my...
18453,Avenge me. In flamboyant impractical fashion.
18454,"That's okay, boy. The two of us got to talking."
18455,Two.
18456,I don't know. Let's just lay here till we figure it out.
18457,Now what do they want?
18458,Camera's broken!
18459,"Oh, I can't believe this day is already here: me taking you for your first driving lesson."
18460,"Hey, that jerk cut us off! Pull alongside!"
18461,"Eat Marshall Tucker, idiot!"
18462,Floor it!
18463,"Whoa, you just blew my mind!"
18464,What's your hurry?
18465,"Aw, my little girl's just like CBS News."
18466,"Hold on there, boy. If you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight."
18467,This cell phone is so I can call you whenever I need your driving services. I've put in my own ring tone!
18468,"Hello, Bart?"
18469,"I need you to go the gas station. Tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs."
18470,Then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.
18471,Bart... buddy! It's your dad! I need a ride! I think I'm in Chinatown. Not our Chinatown.
18472,"Boy, I don't wanna freak you out, but I'm calling from inside the trunk."
18473,That was me. Some very un-cool people put me in here.
18474,It's dark in here!
18475,Bart! This is a matter of life and death: What is the difference between ketchup and catsup?
18476,They're gonna cut my head offff...!
18477,"You know, my great-great grandmother was an Indian. I guess I should've mentioned that before, huh?"
18478,Simpson men get the job done!
18479,"It's a tragedy, a real tragedy. I mean, what kind of tramp gets knocked up before she's even married?"
18480,"I mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific American, where..."
18481,Actually... that was me.
18482,"Why would I go to Utah? I love booze, caffeine, and monogamy."
18483,Did she mention she was knocked up?
18484,Oops. Sorry for the spoiler.
18485,"Yeah, how 'bout that?"
18486,"Son, one day you're going to be a great father."
18487,"Thanks, boy. Hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while I sing public domain songs out the window?"
18488,"I wish when I grow up, I'll be richer than everybody!"
18489,I will! I will be rich! I'll own a football team and a basketball team and I'll make them play baseball!
18490,"It hurts! It hurts so bad! Please, just put one in my brain!"
18491,Thank you.
18492,"Stop it, Winston!"
18493,"When I grow up, I'll have a giant mansion, my own pinball machine with infinity quarters, eight pairs of peanut butter and jelly pajamas. How many wishes do I have left?"
18494,Got it.
18495,No problem.
18496,"Why, of cour-- No."
18497,Squeaky! Squeaky!
18498,"Squeaky, squeaky!"
18499,"Squeaky, squeaky, squeaky!"
18500,Manure for sale! Get your manure! Loamiest in town!
18501,"Hey, the manure dealership is just one of the things I got goin'."
18502,I also have a sweet gig as an infomercial question-asker.
18503,"Um, I know Super Clean cleans, but does it scrub?"
18504,My garage band is getting so tight.
18505,"YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!"
18506,The album cover's gonna be a naked girl with stars for boobs.
18507,And I do open-casket caricatures.
18508,Did he have any hobbies?
18509,The light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
18510,Eh?
18511,Kids? No way! You'll never see a couple of rug-rats tying me down!
18512,You'd better not put this shot after the one where I said I won't have kids. That would be a devastating edit!
18513,"Oh yeah? Check with me in eight years, Dr. Who. I'll be kickin' your ass with a solid gold boot!"
18514,Hm... what's changed for me since the last time I saw you? Only... everything!
18515,Why do you sound so shocked? This is our fifth take.
18516,"Now that I'm super-wealthy, I can buy them whatever their hearts desire. That's why rich kids turn out so well."
18517,This pays a lot better than you think.
18518,"Si, los cales."
18519,INT. LAKESIDE MANSION - KITCHEN - PRESENT
18520,"You see Declan, I made my millions with a simple invention -- ""The Condiment Pen""!"
18521,"Just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish."
18522,I got the idea from the regular pen.
18523,"I don't know. You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care. The point is, I'm rich, rich, rich! Just look -- my dog has his own Jacuzzi!"
18524,He loves it!
18525,"Marge, baby! I got a picture of you tattooed on my chest!"
18526,They had a sale on skulls.
18527,"Uh, this is Eduardo, my pool boy. He thinks he's an angry rich man."
18528,That's the pool chemicals talking.
18529,"Please, Mr. Burns, pretend you work for me. You can have the boy, just don't beat him. You can beat him, just don't leave marks."
18530,I'll tell you why.
18531,"It's been another eight years, and what do I have? Same job, same house, same dirty joke book..."
18532,I just thought for once I could be the cool guy in your movie. But all I am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.
18533,I'll pay for most of this!
18534,"All right, you lured me to your bay. Now what sick game are you playing?"
18535,"Oh, spirit. Are you gonna show me my future? My snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? Well, it's not too late for me to change!"
18536,"You there, boy! Buy me a Christmas goose! The biggest one in the shop!"
18537,Wow. I have a pretty good life after all.
18538,"Relax, Marge. I wasn't gonna kill him."
18539,"All those years I was dreaming of other things, I was actually doing what I really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!"
18540,"Marge, you're my real dream come true. And I get to live you every day."
18541,"Relax, baby. While you were dreaming of me and calling me ""James,"" I took care of everything."
18542,"Eh, stumbled home at dawn, same diff. Now don't worry: I packed everyone's lunches and sent them off into the world."
18543,"Look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. But the school's paying for five sessions and there's a Chinese restaurant next door where I can get drunk."
18544,He's lying!
18545,Look at those dumb hillbillies! I bet they don't even know what... something is.
18546,Look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!
18547,Permission to moan?
18548,"Okay, everyone, straight ahead is my big surprise!"
18549,Look out for the stairs!
18550,"Marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. Because I've got a plan..."
18551,"I'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!"
18552,"Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets."
18553,"What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says ""Dude, don't worry about it. I got this."""
18554,"Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money."
18555,"I've got three bathrooms, don't I? Next."
18556,"Give it here, I'll find some fat we can trim. Here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in."
18557,"No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"
18558,"Come on, Dad, I'm cuttin' back everywhere. To save gas I'm ""Flintstone-ing"" the car."
18559,Yabba... dabba... dooooo...
18560,Why are you telling me? He's your father-in-law.
18561,"Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem."
18562,"What are you doing here, Patty-or-Selma?"
18563,He was a great Dad! Every year he got so mad when Santa didn't bring me presents.
18564,"Well, here we are, home early."
18565,A bear is eating my father!
18566,A talking bear is eating my father!
18567,"Dad, do you know what you were kissing? Do you? Do you?"
18568,"Well I never, ever want to see that again."
18569,"Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?"
18570,It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
18571,"Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. Real classy, Marge. Real classy."
18572,How could my Dad go out with Selma? Don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?
18573,"Words hurt, you know."
18574,Stupid Selma and Grampa... how dare they find happiness?
18575,Oh great. Who are you in love with? Bart?
18576,"Okay, but I'm not good at details. Or the big picture. I also show up late, and drunk."
18577,I've got a good feeling about this.
18578,Selma!
18579,"Hola, I am Esteban de la Sexface. That means Stephen of the Sexface."
18580,Oh baby.
18581,Dos Selmas? Ay-yi-yi!
18582,I guess I always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
18583,"A thousand, eh?"
18584,Nooooooo...
18585,"Oh Lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet."
18586,"Hey Selma, want some rice?"
18587,Spooky.
18588,So... how long is Señor Homer out of town for?
18589,Then I must flee!
18590,Where is he? Where is he? I smell his aftershave!
18591,Where is he? I know he's in here.
18592,"I don't have to make a wish, because I already have this wonderful family. I wish for infinity hamburgers."
18593,"Oh, I get it. These are those trick candles you can't blow out."
18594,E-Z Blo...
18595,This ends now!
18596,Uh-huh... uh-huh...
18597,I'll just focus on one area... How many did I get? None? That's cool.
18598,Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
18599,"Yeah, but uh-- One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad."
18600,Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!
18601,Used to?!
18602,"Oh, deal with it."
18603,"Tick tock, sweetie."
18604,I'm going with the cologne I wore on our first date.
18605,"I don't know. Maybe the Krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode."
18606,"Oh, Captain Janeway! Your mission ended too soon! Too soon..."
18607,"Here I am on the space shuttle, orbiting Earth."
18608,Marge! This isn't like you.
18609,Moderately wealthy?
18610,That's quite an offer -- can I discuss it with my wife?
18611,Then I'll do it!
18612,Krusty! How 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
18613,"How 'bout you, Gabbo?"
18614,"Okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?"
18615,"Okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. You're gonna help me ambush them. Look at this place. Imported beer? Seedless grapes? Chewing gum?"
18616,The clown on this cereal box is just a person!
18617,"Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build."
18618,"Look at those celebrities: I've met them all, and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence."
18619,"Oh, like you care, Betty White."
18620,Her name is Marge.
18621,"Oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!"
18622,No problem. Hey Drederick!
18623,Your hip hop CD was boastful and unnecessary!
18624,What are the first three?
18625,Okay.
18626,I wanted to remember my place in the book I was reading.
18627,"Boy, I never thought I'd have my own dark room."
18628,"Well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals."
18629,Kids. They always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.
18630,That photo's mine. That photo's mine. That photo's mine.
18631,"See Marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down."
18632,Did I attach the harness?
18633,If you don't mind!
18634,Thank you!
18635,Now to make a young woman's wedding day all about me!
18636,"Up, up, and annoy!"
18637,I also wreck bar mitzvahs!
18638,"First Amendment rules, privacy drools!"
18639,"Now Maggie, I had to use your car seat to hold the new TV Guide...so I'm gonna hang you from the mirror."
18640,"He's trying to make me look like a bad father. Maggie, take the wheel!"
18641,"Ten and two, Einstein!"
18642,Can't I even have privacy here?!
18643,How could you publish this? I thought we were friends!
18644,And then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.
18645,You're right -- I'm giving up photography...
18646,And my own medicine!
18647,"So long, anti-clotting agent!"
18648,Clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!
18649,Listen to 'em. They're on top of the world while I'm sittin' here pretending I have a stool.
18650,All because of a bunch of stuff that happened.
18651,You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. But I threw away my camera.
18652,"Thanks, Moe!"
18653,How do you want your comeuppance: eight by ten or wallet size?
18654,Nothing.
18655,Providing you celebrities do something for me.
18656,I want you all to show some respect for the people who made you what you are. Sign an autograph or two... support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family... let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book!
18657,"Ooh, Papa John's."
18658,What's wrong?
18659,"Oh Marge, you gotta get on the net. It's got all the best conspiracy theories. Did you know that Hezbollah owns Little Dolly Snack Cakes? This stuff will rock your world."
18660,Never!
18661,Why don't I just put on a dress?!
18662,"Not naked, I haven't."
18663,...our duties as firemen.
18664,"Hey, Lisa, self-conscious about your shins? In my day, girls were worried about their boobs."
18665,"Wait, that's soccer? I always called it ""human foosball."" Would you like me to take you to your game?"
18666,Do I have to?
18667,"Did someone say ""snack""?"
18668,I'll be your ref!
18669,I got fired from Foot Locker.
18670,"What'sa matter, buddy? The American flag not good enough for ya?"
18671,I'm your father now.
18672,I'm open! I'm open!
18673,So... tired.
18674,Could someone bring me another barf cone?
18675,So... I thought it went real well. Until I swallowed the whistle.
18676,Hilarious joke?
18677,Hand ball! Direct kick!
18678,"Thanks, honey. After what you said to me, I watched hours and hours of soccer. I almost saw a goal! But there were so many ads for Spanish cell phones..."
18679,Foul on twenty-three!
18680,I said foul on twenty-three!
18681,Well I'm throwing you both out of the game!
18682,"Foul on the other girl. Lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!"
18683,She has not! Your daughter's a dirty player!
18684,I don't need a soccer lecture from a hillbilly!
18685,Ronaldo?! Winner of two World Cups and three FIFA player of the year awards?
18686,Yellow card!
18687,"When I put on these shorts, I'm not your father anymore. And judging by how tight they are, I'm never gonna be anyone else's either."
18688,Un-sportsman-like conduct.
18689,That's a red card. You're out of the game!
18690,"Lisa, sweetie, I was just following the rules."
18691,"Son, I'll never understand women if I live to be forty."
18692,You said it -- enjoy me while I last.
18693,Wanna watch me?
18694,Lisa's mad at me and Marge is mad at him.
18695,Yeah. What have you done with the real Moe?
18696,"Lisa, honey, I bought you something. A DVD!"
18697,It's a documentary... by the B.B.C... in cooperation with Canal Plus...
18698,"Sweetie, are you here to forgive me?"
18699,But to get that DVD I had to become a PBS subscriber! Now I'm paying for crap like American Masters!
18700,Those places are pretty terrible.
18701,I sure do.
18702,Look what I can do!
18703,"Oh, that's long gone, baby. Long gone."
18704,"I got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world."
18705,No more lazy Saturdays for you.
18706,My son caught the ball! This makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!
18707,"I hate shopping. I'm bored, my feet hurt, I'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""
18708,There must be another chair.
18709,I guess I could just sit on a bed...
18710,"Wow, this is soft..."
18711,Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.
18712,Sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.
18713,How many?!
18714,"Well, who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this? It works with my body's natural curves and supports my back-boobs."
18715,I don't work here.
18716,Woo hoo!
18717,"But it did happen. Just yesterday, in Crazytown."
18718,Knock it off! He's just a kid!
18719,"Hey, get off my case! He's the choke artist!"
18720,"Marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago."
18721,"Oh yeah, let's see where that goes."
18722,"Let me tell you about a land where it rains beer and hails pretzels, and you can play swim-up blackjack with Abraham Lincoln! It's the land of sleep. And your passport: a simple mattress."
18723,A common problem. Try this.
18724,"Sex problem, eh?"
18725,"Relax. I'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. And I've got the answer to your problems -- the Snugulux, by Matrimonium!"
18726,"And remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. Okay, who else is dead in bed?"
18727,"The Lovejoys?! If this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you I had had like a million Doritos -- you know, the ones with the flame on the bag? Oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!"
18728,What's wrong with it?
18729,"Oh, I think I know what you're doing wrong. Have you tried..."
18730,I'll write you a check.
18731,Pay to the order of... Stupid Reverend... memo: bite my ass ... Wha?!
18732,On one condition: you do the shlepping.
18733,Move over just a...
18734,"Wrong, wrong, wrong!"
18735,"Yeah... something has changed, but I can't figure out what. Our mattress! I traded it to the Lovejoys!"
18736,"It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky."
18737,I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
18738,Lousy Reverend. He's having my sex! While I'm at home with Marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
18739,"Look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here."
18740,Sorry.
18741,"Well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover."
18742,You would be.
18743,Or a chicken club... or a Reuben... or a Monte Cristo... or a... Pull over behind that billboard!
18744,"It's like our honeymoon all over again. Aw, we even have the same bum looking at us."
18745,Woo hoo!
18746,"I couldn't find Maggie's brand, but I got every other kind I could find. How about ""Syntho-Nip?"""
18747,"Kiddy Cork? ""Thumbstitute?"" ""AccuTeat?"" ""Bink 182?"""
18748,Wanna suck on the receipt?
18749,"Good work, boy. Just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""
18750,Stupid baby... growing her brain... on my dime!
18751,Mm-hm.
18752,"Okay Nappien, do your stuff."
18753,"It's not working! You lousy, worthless piece of--"
18754,"What a wonderful night's sleep. Thank you methasorbizone tartrate, also known as Nappien."
18755,"That's ridiculous. If I had set up those dominoes, I'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads."
18756,How is that possible?
18757,Mood swings?! Mood swings. Mood swings!
18758,"Mood swings? Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings! Mood swings, mood swings! Mood swings!"
18759,"Nappien, you did it again! And everything is as it should be."
18760,John Lennon?!
18761,Yoko?
18762,"Well son, your Uncle Homer is, like eighty percent of America, whacked-out on prescription drugs."
18763,You're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.
18764,"Okay, here's the solution -- I want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so I can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief."
18765,Because I'm filled with stress!
18766,I have three kids and no money! Why can't I have no kids and three money?
18767,Zombie kill.
18768,Zombie file grievance.
18769,Mm-hm.
18770,Zombie montage:
18771,What the?! My car?! Milhouse?! Nutmeat?!
18772,Oh my God! What have I done?!
18773,"What are you, a travel agent? 'Cause you're sending me on a guilt trip."
18774,I feel kinda responsible. Maybe I should volunteer to be a fireman.
18775,"Oh, I can't wait for my first fire. Is that one?"
18776,Is that one?
18777,I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.
18778,Any moment...
18779,Any moment...
18780,Did I say any moment?
18781,Any moment...
18782,What the hell is that?
18783,Woo hoo!
18784,"Marge, when you see me next I'll be a soggy, smoky hero. Mmm, soggy, smoky hero."
18785,Don't tell me how to do my job!
18786,We don't get what?
18787,Burns stiffed us!
18788,"Hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes."
18789,I hope it's spaghetti!
18790,"Lousy burns so ungrateful, I hate him so much..."
18791,Well... most of it.
18792,And some stuff I wanted.
18793,"Yeah, we're awesome. This'll make a great toilet seat!"
18794,Just what are you getting at?
18795,"Oh, thank God there's a fire. Marge's birthday's comin' up."
18796,Look at me! I'm a fireman!
18797,"Hey guys, check out the radical-free air generated by my stolen Ionic Breeze."
18798,"Oh, bogus gizmo, grant me eternal life."
18799,"Look at me, guys!"
18800,"I'm stealing five Segways at once! And speaking of segues, I'm off to my next morally questionable activity!"
18801,"We're not thieves, we're scavengers! Like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or America's sweetheart, the maggot."
18802,Make them stop!
18803,"Moe, can we talk?"
18804,"Moe, I think we may have perverted..."
18805,"Moe, I can save you but you have to let go of the clock."
18806,"So Daddy saved Apu and Moe, and believe me, we learned our lesson."
18807,We sent it to skid row where it would do the most good.
18808,"Oh man, I love Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest!"
18809,You stuffed your horn?!
18810,"Where the hell is Abigail Adams?! Oh, there she is. Where the hell is Mary Todd Lincoln?! Oh, she's right there. Where the hell is Ida Saxton McKinley?! Oh I see. Where the hell is--"
18811,Betcha can't solve our maze? I didn't come here to be insulted. We're leaving!
18812,Sure is a lot of corn in this parking lot.
18813,"Split up?! Marge, no! We can fix this marriage!"
18814,"Fine, you want out? Then go! I can make it on my own! Before I met you I had friends and dreams!"
18815,Oh please take me back. The dating scene is a nightmare. I'm begging you!
18816,"Deep down, I... I guess I knew that."
18817,Of our marriage?! I don't want to live!
18818,"Hey, this maze is made of corn!"
18819,I'm so sick of being lost. To hell with maze etiquette! I'm walking straight outta here!
18820,Dammit!
18821,How come things that happen to stupid people keep happening to me?
18822,I'm lost and I'm starving!
18823,I don't have any holders!
18824,"""To my wife Marge -- in case I don't make it, here are my Oscar picks for next year: Best Sound Effects Editing, the team from--"""
18825,No. And never bring it up again.
18826,All right.
18827,"Now that he's had a taste of human flesh, the dog will be a slave to its succulence! Look at him eyeing me -- he knows I taste best."
18828,"Oh relax, Marge, I'm just messin' with ya. I know I'm not a dog. I'm a people, like you."
18829,"Cheer up, boy. We'll get you their most vicious street cur! He'll bite your ass raw!"
18830,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not made of money!"
18831,Why you little... I'll teach you to trick your sister!
18832,"Well, I can breathe out okay."
18833,Don't... give snake... attention... it's what... he really... wants.
18834,I'm okay.
18835,"Hey, get your own yogurt!"
18836,Woo-hoo! Business trip!
18837,"Apu, I'm returning a yogurt I wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with."
18838,"Hey Milhouse, who're you spying on? Those bullies?"
18839,"Hey, lay off -- you're the fat one of you guys!"
18840,I'm still alive! You call that playing to win?!
18841,"This is our life now, Milhouse. We're dumpster folk."
18842,"Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? Mine is. Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. Well, let's get some shut-eye."
18843,"Ooh, it's that bar I like! Wait here in the car."
18844,"Okay, Milhouse, what do you want to do?"
18845,Ol' Betsy'll get us there.
18846,Cops! Act natural!
18847,"Hello, Officer!"
18848,"Rice Krispie Treats? Way to phone it in, Sarah Wiggum!"
18849,Can I have some more money?
18850,All the other moms gave their husbands twenty.
18851,"I had to fight! Lenny said his dad is Hulk Hogan, and I know he's not!"
18852,You butcher!
18853,"Ooh, a thermos! With seven cups of coffee still in it! Oh wait, six!"
18854,Here! It's yours!
18855,"Oh, I'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!"
18856,"C'mon, everybody. Time for the family portrait. Let's bunch together now. Here we go."
18857,Move it!
18858,Perfecto. Everybody smile. I'm going to set the automatic timer.
18859,Almost ready! Here we go.
18860,"Okay, here we go."
18861,What'd you say?
18862,"All right, everybody. Squeeze in real tight."
18863,I wanna get us all in the picture this time. Closer.
18864,Closer.
18865,Okay. Hold still. This is the last picture on the role.
18866,You watch your mouth you little Smartass.
18867,Nothing's gonna ruin this one. The timer's a tickin.
18868,Bart!
18869,This one's gonna be the Simpsons at our finest.
18870,Smile. Look cheerful. Here we go...
18871,Here we go... Here we go.
18872,Why you little...
18873,"Hey suckers, check it out. Marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery."
18874,Why the cemetery? I wondered. But my dreams were too strong.
18875,"Absolutely, all the time. I go to the floss store and they're like, ""Whoa, there he is again."" 'Cause I buy so much floss."
18876,"Oh God, my gums! They hurt so much!"
18877,"I know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth."
18878,I don't even have a special tooth problem! This is just a routine check-up! The bib is choking me!
18879,It's over? That wasn't so bad.
18880,This is the greatest movie ever!
18881,I have a right to my views.
18882,Sure do. Let's go get ice cream!
18883,I'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!
18884,"What the hell is a ""fundae""?"
18885,"I like that. But I'm on a bit of a health kick, so I'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: Snickles, Gooey Bears, Charlottesville Chew, Nice 'N' Many, Kat Kit, Herschel's Smooches, Mrs. Bad Bar, and Milk Dudes."
18886,Uh... cone!
18887,"Oh my God, this is amazing! Wait, I'm gonna be driving. I'll go for the cup."
18888,"Fine, cone."
18889,What's this?!
18890,"America West, please."
18891,That's me!
18892,"I've never been to war, but I imagine it feels just like your first kill. The happiness swept me away!"
18893,"Well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. That makes us friends, right?"
18894,Okay.
18895,The happiness swept me away!
18896,Oh.
18897,"Marge, the couch is lumpy!"
18898,Kent Brockman!
18899,"I'm sorry Marge, but I won't live under the same roof as a member of the ""liberal media""."
18900,Did you know that every day Mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
18901,"Oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!"
18902,"I'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. You can stay. But you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our Wall of Casual Acquaintances Who Came to Stay For A While."
18903,Apu sang a song. What are you gonna do?
18904,What a great show: real people with real problems!
18905,Liberals -- I hate them so much!
18906,Woo hoo!
18907,Liberals!
18908,Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals!
18909,Woo--
18910,Hoo!
18911,Woo hoo? Liberals? Woo hoo?
18912,True -- but there's room for the truth in this household. Do you wanna hear something really bad Kent told me about the Fox network?
18913,"I know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. For years now, Fox has been--"
18914,I'm afraid they might. But I will not be silenced. The truth is...
18915,"Okay. What I was going to say, was..."
18916,"Hey, you're not a penny."
18917,Me? But that's you!
18918,Uh-huh. See you at five then.
18919,"Dinner with Mr. Burns! What a waste of my precious, precious Saturday night."
18920,He is not my boyfriend!
18921,I do.
18922,My favorite is Chicago deep dish.
18923,Drive to Chicago? I don't have time for that. I have to be back at work on Monday. And my boss is a total jerk.
18924,A P-P-P-P-P-Private jet!
18925,"Yeah, but I'm on a plane, idiot."
18926,I'm aroused and confused.
18927,This is wonderful.
18928,"Oh my God... Lionel Richie?! Can you sing ""Say You Say me,"" but make it about beer?"
18929,"Now make every word ""beer."""
18930,"BEER BEER, BEER BEER / BEER BEER BEER BEER BEER..."
18931,"Um, wait, I forgot the words."
18932,"No! If I leave the plane, I'll be just like everyone else!"
18933,I wanna be back on the plane.
18934,Svetlana! Svetlana!
18935,I came to relax -- you think of it!
18936,Drunk!
18937,Why are you applauding them? We wrote it!
18938,I'm so happy!
18939,No way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! I flew on a private plane.
18940,Please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
18941,"I had it all for one night. Now for the rest of my life I'll know what I'm missing. And all I have to remember it by is that my ears haven't popped. Well, I'll make sure that I never yawn again."
18942,High? High like a private plane? The kind I'll never be invited to ride on again.
18943,A fresh face!
18944,"No way. I don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or ""guru""."
18945,"Oh, tell me more!"
18946,"If you're gonna film me, I insist on a body double."
18947,"The camera's not on yet, right?"
18948,"Okay. Uh... well uh... hm, I just uh. I forget what I do."
18949,"Wait, wait. Uh, this is some of what I do, I think. Sometimes I go places."
18950,This is our relish tray. I'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.
18951,What's the point of putting my socks on? I just have to take them off again a week later.
18952,"Fine, I'll show you a winner, just you watch."
18953,Think positive. Think positive.
18954,You were saying...
18955,Will you shut up? I can't hear the song in my head!
18956,I've really enjoyed paying you to yell at me and say I suck. But it's no use -- I'm a hopeless loser and always will be.
18957,This I can do!
18958,Behold my two-seventeen average... and weep!
18959,"As I said, I've lost all hope."
18960,Is this going somewhere?
18961,"Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman, you're a genius!"
18962,I wasn't talking to you.
18963,How many of those have private planes?
18964,Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing?
18965,"I'm gettin' that job. Bart, I'll need some clean urine. Stat."
18966,"Well, I can see the position of handsomest C.E.O. is already taken."
18967,I got the job!
18968,"I'm gonna get there early, so I can get in good with the lunch truck guy."
18969,"Uh, yeah -- I have no job and nowhere to go. What do I have to buy so I can sit here all day?"
18970,"One small coffee, please. And a dozen of those placemats with the maze on it."
18971,Somebody's gotta do 'em.
18972,Look happy.
18973,"Oh, it was great! Flew to Tulsa on the company jet. Did my job in a way consistent with what I already told you. Because that's what you do. When you have a job."
18974,Stop peppering me with questions!
18975,"Well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... I lied. I didn't get the job. You see when I got there..."
18976,"So she said that's not my ""in box"" and he said that's not the Johnson Report!"
18977,"Um... um...c'mon, say ""you're hired""!"
18978,Say it!
18979,Say it!
18980,"Stop saying ""security""!"
18981,"I couldn't bear to tell your mother, so I hang out here all day."
18982,"Brands like ""Miser's Choice"" and ""Day-Old Delights?"""
18983,"Honey, there's something I have to tell you..."
18984,"No, it's, uh... good news!"
18985,"We're manufacturing a new pipe diameter, five-eighths inch. The company wants you and me to take the private plane to New York for the premiere! So meet me at Shelbyville Airport in an hour."
18986,"If I'm gonna tell that woman the truth, I'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad."
18987,"Okay, so this should be enough money to get me up in the air, have a frank talk with Marge then maybe eat a devilled egg."
18988,"Yeah, uh... semper fudge!"
18989,"No, I said the right thing."
18990,Honey... don't try to remember the whole day. Just what you're feeling this second.
18991,Marge... I've gotta be honest...
18992,I don't know. Maybe we flew through a rainbow.
18993,I drove a car over a cliff once. How different could it be?
18994,"Hm, what's the ocean doing in the sky?"
18995,I'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
18996,Duke? That's good.
18997,Vanderbilt?
18998,What? I'll show him. I'll show that guy!
18999,"And now, to taxi to the terminal."
19000,"Oh yes, of course."
19001,"Marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. That's why I've decided to go to the plant and beg Mr. Burns for my old job back."
19002,"You'd think so, but no."
19003,"So long, suckers!"
19004,Move it! Move it! Move it! Do you want to be second out of the parking lot? Do you?
19005,Leave her!
19006,"You'll never catch me, Lord!"
19007,"Oh man, that church service was so boring. I did a whole book of Find-A-Words."
19008,Those are words.
19009,I wanna say one.
19010,Denny's.
19011,"Don't worry, we'll just go home. Your mother can cook."
19012,Woo hoo!
19013,"Lisa's right, son. Your Mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--"
19014,"Everyone just act cool. If anyone asks, tell them we're plumbers... and then start plumbing until they go away."
19015,"Dude! You don't think you know me, but you do!"
19016,"Mmmm, au jus! Not quite gravy, not quite blood..."
19017,"Oh, I can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!"
19018,"Come on, we're leaving! Mmm, after one more mini-quiche..."
19019,Will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?
19020,Of course.
19021,I thought she said polar bear.
19022,"My back! It hurts, and not in a good way!"
19023,Stop that! I'm down here!
19024,"Well, you're always telling me I should eat more dirt."
19025,Which grow in what?
19026,My pleasure. IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU / IT WOULDN'T BE IN SUMMER. / SEEING YOU IN SUMMER I NEVER WOULD GO...
19027,YOUR HAIR STREAKED WITH SUN-LIGHT /
19028,"YOUR LIPS RED AS FLAME, / YOUR FACE WITH A LUSTER / THAT PUTS GOLD TO SHAME!"
19029,"BUT IF I'D EVER LEAVE YOU, / IT COULDN'T BE IN AUTUMN. / HOW I'D LEAVE IN AUTUMN I NEVER WILL KNOW..."
19030,AND COULD I LEAVE YOU / RUNNING MERRILY THROUGH THE SNOW?
19031,KNOWING HOW IN SPRING I'M BEWITCHED BY YOU SO?
19032,"OH, NO! NOT IN SPRING-TIME! / SUMMER, WINTER OR FALL! NO, NEVER COULD I LEAVE YOU AT ALL!"
19033,But I can only sing lying on my back.
19034,"Oh, oh, I just have one question: what is this movie about?"
19035,"Excuse me, ""film."""
19036,HO DANNEGGIATO IL MIO PIEDE!
19037,NEI CIELI BIGI GUARDO FUMAR DAI MILLE COMIGNOLI PARIGI.
19038,MIMI!
19039,MIMI!
19040,Woo-hoo!
19041,Well I didn't mean to!
19042,"Oh, good. This makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance."
19043,"Sorry, Lisa. Can't change the future."
19044,AND THE HOME OF THE BRA-A-AVE!
19045,"Wow, praise from Placido Domingo."
19046,"Eh, I'll think about it."
19047,"Thanks! You know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! No wait, I forgot about that other guy. Sorry, you're third."
19048,"Hmmm, what if you gave it a little more of this flavor..."
19049,"Keep reachin' for the stars, kid."
19050,"Happy anniversary, Sweetie."
19051,But I need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. Would you have me keep it fake?
19052,My pleasure.
19053,To the hottest girls in the room.
19054,I said you look hot! Hot! Ay Chihuahua!
19055,Hua-hua!
19056,No problem.
19057,"And may I say I'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?"
19058,What? That's how guys talk.
19059,"You guys go on, we're gonna walk home."
19060,"Marge, when I'm onstage I can only sing those love songs by picturing your beautiful face. So in a way, my groupies are really our groupies."
19061,"Not me, they love me."
19062,"Die, you stupid cobra, die!"
19063,"A lady motorcycle driver?! What is this, the Twilight Zone?"
19064,"So did you see the show tonight? Remember the part where I forgot the words and I just sang ""Uh-oh Spaghetti-os"". I'm hoping they send me a case."
19065,Marge!
19066,"Um, everyone's wearing clothes in here."
19067,"Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out."
19068,"That's it! Let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to Marge and you can never, ever have it. This opera's over when the fat man sings."
19069,"That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left."
19070,"Julia, wait!"
19071,"Before you go, could you hire your own replacement? But make sure she's not crazy like you."
19072,"Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol."
19073,D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH / WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO HOO / STU STU STU STU-PID FLANDERS...
19074,"GET LOST, YOU WASTE OF A MOUSTACHE!"
19075,"Well that's it, I'm retiring from the opera. It's just too popular."
19076,And I know something much more fun I can do on my back.
19077,Singing opera made me good at painting.
19078,YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME WANNA
19079,THROW MY HANDS UP AND
19080,KICK MY HEELS UP AND
19081,HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
19082,A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW!
19083,HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY!
19084,No problem.
19085,"My, you've grown."
19086,Spilled milk?!
19087,All over the floor.
19088,"Hey Apu, what happened to all your milk?"
19089,Does it work?
19090,"Hey Moe, got any milk?"
19091,It's paint. Or is it?
19092,"Yeah, it's paint."
19093,I've gotta find milk somewhere!
19094,At first I thought you were pointing to your crotch.
19095,That's my car!
19096,"Aw, please, give me a break. I've been driving all night looking for milk for my kids."
19097,Okay. Let me just grab my registration.
19098,I can't believe your boss lets you listen to rock music while you work.
19099,"Wow, I'd really like to meet this guy."
19100,But it's just you and me... That must mean I'm your boss. I'm sick of you! You're fired!
19101,"Shut up! When you call in sick, who do you call?"
19102,Sometimes you want to work?
19103,Street cattle?
19104,I think it goes here.
19105,Some of those were pretty funny.
19106,"Wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. Just like God."
19107,"Man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!"
19108,I would love to! But I don't have a tow truck.
19109,I'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.
19110,"Uh, that's still too sexy for my wife."
19111,"Man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life."
19112,"...which I previously alluded... Are there two ""l's"" in ""alluded""?"
19113,Why? What happens if I point it this way?
19114,"Ah, my first tow."
19115,"Ah, my first tow."
19116,Really? What's your handicap?
19117,I'm doing my job!
19118,You're hovering over a hydrant!
19119,"I've got tow dough I'm lookin' to blow, Moe!"
19120,I'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.
19121,Outside? That's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.
19122,"Marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end."
19123,"Hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be."
19124,"Guess what, boy. Last night I towed your principal's car."
19125,"It's Homer, idiot."
19126,I guess I'm more powerful than God now.
19127,Who said that? I'll kill them with my power!
19128,Oh my God... multiple tickets... handicapped spot... parked by a hydrant... incomprehensible vanity plate...
19129,"If my life as a tow truck driver were a teleplay, this would be the end of act two."
19130,What? I'm still in Springfield.
19131,"Okay, I made a mistake. Why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?"
19132,"Put me down, you lousy-- Wheeee! Okay, I'm warning you-- Wheeee! I'll kill you, you son of a-- Wheeee! All right buddy, that's it, I've had-- Whee--!"
19133,You... let... go...
19134,"Ooh, a trap door. What's down there? Your meatball collection?"
19135,I thought we were friends! I was kidding you in a friendly fashion!
19136,Who are you guys?
19137,Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?
19138,"Okay, I get it. I'm not stupid. It's number two, right?"
19139,Do not worry. I am working.
19140,"Ask no questions. And do not call the police, or I will kill me."
19141,All is well. Goodbye forever.
19142,And all the Transformers transformed back into trucks and cars. The end.
19143,"Okay, we've got time for one more."
19144,"Once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named Shrek Three. He lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times..."
19145,"And if elected president of our small community, I will determine once and for all how far we can go without being gay."
19146,Maggie!
19147,We're free!
19148,Maggie! You did all this?!
19149,"And to pay you back, I'm returning your nose."
19150,Here's your nose. Daddy's putting back your nose.
19151,"Oh, wait. That's Lisa's nose."
19152,Thanks to her!
19153,"Wow, Bart! Lookin' good!"
19154,Right... tomorrow.
19155,Think. Think.
19156,"You have to think, it's your job!"
19157,Why you little...
19158,What?! Name twelve.
19159,American sober or Irish sober?
19160,Point one five.
19161,Point one oh with a stomach full of bread. My final offer.
19162,"Goodnight, sweetheart."
19163,Can't be late for Lisa's big day...
19164,I'm gonna make it! I'll be on time for Lisa's thing!
19165,"Ooo, an awesome accident! Easy, easy... I'll just take three seconds to gawk. Aw, everyone's okay."
19166,Gonna make it! Gonna make it!
19167,Woo hoo!
19168,"Hmmm. Well, Marge, who's the unfit parent now?"
19169,"An hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. With my free time I can finally work on my ""Superman"" novel."
19170,"""Make way for Superman,"" said Superman as he punched everyone at the Coffee Bean. Chapter Two..."""
19171,"Oh, hello, Marge. I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No."
19172,"What?! Oh my God, my sweet Margie! Okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero."
19173,"Chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!"
19174,"Oh Marge, I was afraid I was going to lose you! Ohhh! Now let me help you make your slow transition back to society."
19175,You have a new home now... with us.
19176,"Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
19177,You don't owe him anything. Moe was in the hospital for three weeks and I didn't visit him once.
19178,"Moe the tavern, not Moe the person."
19179,"Hey Marge, look at us -- the four amigos! They're gonna let me do some odd jobs for them on the outside."
19180,"The problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you."
19181,Why does he always bring up my weight?
19182,"Don't worry, sir. I'll handle this cleanly, quietly and Bart!"
19183,"Marge, I'm gonna be home late tonight. I'm going to... Midnight Monkey Madness at the zoo."
19184,Have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.
19185,"Now all I have to do is think of a clever line before I pull the trigger. Oh, that's a perfect one. But I don't need to say it out loud, 'cause I'm by myself."
19186,"Out of my way, mystery skank!"
19187,Hey! Now I don't get paid!
19188,Now I'm mad!
19189,Now I'm .
19190,Marge is a professional assassin!
19191,"Hey, what's that?"
19192,"Great, great -- I turned over so many wheelbarrows... Wait, that was your thing."
19193,"Seconds, please."
19194,I'll kill her after dessert!
19195,You ruined that pie!
19196,How could you not tell me?
19197,"Well, they're not as pretty as you, Marge."
19198,"Okay, here's the deal, I'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids."
19199,I just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.
19200,"I was out getting drunk, then killing people!"
19201,Why do you think I'm kicking it?
19202,"Hey, who wants ice cream in bed?"
19203,At your funeral.
19204,"Oh, that was so hot! I love watching you do other guys!"
19205,That can be arranged.
19206,"...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom."
19207,Crème brûlée! Crème brûlée! Or in English: Burnt Cream! Burnt Cream!
19208,"Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes."
19209,"How about a little neck rub, baby?"
19210,"Now, how 'bout the neck of my butt..."
19211,"Oh Marge, your tentacles feel so good. Wait a minute... why am I getting words in edgewise?"
19212,"Don't worry, son -- I've got a plan to save your space doggy."
19213,Who is it?
19214,"Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on!"
19215,"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
19216,"Wow, you guys are good. The alien's right here in the living room."
19217,"Hop in, Bart, they're gonna let us kill one!"
19218,Homer -- bored!
19219,Quiet -- we're missing the dissection!
19220,No one likes a know-it-all.
19221,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh..."
19222,"Oh, lighten up. It's Halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment."
19223,Hold still! I'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!
19224,More bread please.
19225,"Hm, I thought I was killed by that magic spaghetti!"
19226,"Okay Maggie, just calmly and carefully back away."
19227,Beehive!
19228,Blueberries!
19229,Way to go! Many happy returns.
19230,There are so many choices. Bolo? Clip on? Piano keys? Ten Commandments of Beer?
19231,The cornerstones of the Brewish faith.
19232,And what color would that be?
19233,Of course I know!
19234,Uh...
19235,"Is ""beautiful"" a color?"
19236,"Marge, give me a break! I don't notice the color of people's eyes! I just judge them on the color of their skin."
19237,She's wearing white? She must have rolled the odometer back to zero.
19238,Spaz.
19239,"...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms."
19240,"Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me."
19241,Sleep tight. The Container Store now has five convenient locations!
19242,"Don't worry, boy. They'll find your parents soon."
19243,And we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.
19244,"Hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of Ocean Spray? Oh boy -- forget that. How about some... Cap'n Crunch? Uh, Seven Seas Italian dressing? No, no! Uh, Chicken of the Sea tuna? Billy Ocean CD? The history of Atlantic Records?"
19245,"I want to, but I can't!"
19246,"Good idea. I'll drown my sorrows in Anchor Steam Beer! Oh, I'm sorry!"
19247,Where is it?
19248,I gotta find out what color Marge's eyes are.
19249,Cha-ching!
19250,"Oh Marge darling, what's the combination to our wedding album?"
19251,"Boy, stop talking to yourself!"
19252,"Your thoughts should stay in your head! Heh, heh, I sure told him. Now, what am I gonna do about Marge?"
19253,"Oh, I'll never remember what color Marge's eyes are!"
19254,Brown? No. Orange? No. Elm? Rake? Guessing?
19255,"A song? Wait, it's coming back to me."
19256,THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL HAIR / A BLUE BOUFFANT FROM HERE TO THERE
19257,SNOW WHITE TEETH AND LIPS SO RED / SHE'S THE WILMA TO MY FRED
19258,OH THE GIRL I LOVE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL... EYES
19259,"/ WHEN HAPPY THEY SPARKLE, WHEN SAD THEY CRIES"
19260,"/ THOSE EYES ARE GEMS BEYOND APPRAISAL / STUNNING SHADE OF PUREST... Oh, what is it?! I was so close! Let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! Oh, it's hopeless! She'll never love me again."
19261,"Hazel! Your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw I ate after we first made love."
19262,Mmm... porkpie.
19263,"Marge, I wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?"
19264,We're gonna be rich! We can finally start a family!
19265,A better one!
19266,"Oh yeah, Marge, I love these business trips of yours. The TV remote isn't nailed on. My whole life, I've never been in a hotel that trusted me."
19267,"Hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. Now I know why pimps are so happy."
19268,I hear that.
19269,"Fine, I admit it. I'm drunk!"
19270,"Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Homer. My wife invented a gym for ""regular"" women."
19271,I pay ten dollars a tube for those!
19272,"Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get."
19273,Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words.
19274,Marge won't dump me. I'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.
19275,That will never happen!
19276,Marge! Marge!
19277,A makeover!
19278,Oh my God! The prophecy is being fulfilled.
19279,"Um, so... tell me about your day."
19280,I do! I do!
19281,"Hey, the networks have different channels in this city."
19282,Are you happy and full of life?
19283,Old one?! They're convincing Marge to dump me!
19284,"Marge, get away from them!"
19285,"You guys gotta help me! If Marge leaves I'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make."
19286,What's your secret?
19287,Uh-huh.
19288,Okay.
19289,Fashions.
19290,"Uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. I know just what it'll take to hang onto Marge."
19291,"Please, Doc. I know I'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but I took care of my family, and that used to be enough. But not anymore."
19292,And I know how I can knock myself out. I'll look at your bill.
19293,"Hm. I guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. I've never seen anything so reasonable! It's the bargain of a lifetime! And--"
19294,"Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother."
19295,"No, I had my stomach stapled!"
19296,All food tastes like barf now.
19297,"Welcome home, Marge."
19298,A smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.
19299,Do you like guys who are... attractive?
19300,"All for you, baby."
19301,"Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. Why don't you take some time to savor the front?"
19302,"Uh, it used to be."
19303,"Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now."
19304,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
19305,"Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. And it's all because of your surgery!"
19306,"No, I want you to give me every other surgery you have so I can look good! And can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?"
19307,Did someone order a super stud?
19308,My implants feel itchy.
19309,You better not make me cry. 'Cause I don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
19310,"I don't want to live without you, Marge."
19311,Noooo!
19312,Huh? Why do I look like me again?
19313,Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster.
19314,"I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it."
19315,"Listen Marge... I've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? Let's face it... you could do better."
19316,Aw...
19317,"Now ignore all the fancy-shmancy thingamajigs, boy. We're just gonna get a camera battery and go home."
19318,No thanks -- just here for a battery.
19319,All I want is a battery.
19320,"Battery, battery, battery!"
19321,Hmm...
19322,No...
19323,Bingo!
19324,"One battery, please."
19325,Sold! Sucker.
19326,My what now?
19327,"C'mon, Lisa! The TV's been off for five whole minutes!"
19328,"I spit on your corpse, advertiser-supported television!"
19329,Why is everything Hollywood makes so excellent? Whyyyy?
19330,Sometimes I think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.
19331,"Good luck, with my finicky appetite."
19332,Sold!
19333,THAT'S HOW THEY GETCHA!
19334,More ribs for me!
19335,More ribs for me!
19336,More ribs for me?
19337,"Finally, some service. Now listen. We wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- Michigan or better."
19338,"Next time a commercial comes on, I'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as I can."
19339,I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
19340,"Mr. Doobner, I have a complaint: I work hard, and when I go out with my family, I expect a certain level of basic--"
19341,Nobody do it.
19342,"Finally, the ribs."
19343,Yet another new restaurant fails.
19344,He cheats at Uno!
19345,"Yeah, well, between you and me, I still can't stand him."
19346,I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him... I still can't stand him...
19347,I don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...
19348,Now?
19349,But I'm getting a home perm!
19350,Uh-huh.
19351,Yes.
19352,No.
19353,Oh yeah!
19354,"A doctor, huh?"
19355,I remember.
19356,Uh-huh.
19357,Are you done? 'Cause I've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.
19358,"Hey, what smells so good?"
19359,Eat hobo remains!
19360,"Marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins."
19361,Yeah. The only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!
19362,"Wow, I must have really tied one on last night."
19363,No more drinking.
19364,Six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at three a.m.
19365,Where's Marge?
19366,"Hey, kids! Have you seen your mother?"
19367,Or yourselves?
19368,"Maggie? Has anyone seen anyone?! Oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. Without me!"
19369,Save some suds for--
19370,Daddy...
19371,Hey boy! Do you know where the family is? Show me on Mapquest.
19372,Fine. Google Maps.
19373,"What's going on, why are you attacking me? Look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in Good 'N' Plenty colors!"
19374,"Moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and I can't remember what happened last night. Was I here?"
19375,"A ""Forget-Me-Shot?"" Never heard of it."
19376,"Mmm, pickle..."
19377,"Oh my God, why would I wanna wipe out my memory? What horrible thing did I do?"
19378,Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...
19379,Marge had a black eye?! I could never do something like that! Could I?
19380,Flanders!
19381,The queen's private surgeonnn!
19382,What did I do?
19383,"What happened in this room? If only these walls could talk... people would pay to come see my amazing talking walls. And I could use that money to-- Hey, a memory!"
19384,"Dad, I can't remember what I did last night. Do you have any idea?"
19385,Your memory bubble and you.
19386,I'm afraid I did something to make Marge and the kids leave me.
19387,"Really? Well, that's great, Dad. How can I ever repay you?"
19388,Done.
19389,How 'bout The Deja Viewmaster?
19390,Remembrance of things fast?
19391,The Rememberererer?
19392,"This is great! I'm finally gonna find out how I ruined my family! Strap me in, nerd!"
19393,Bo-ring.
19394,"Ow. Ow. Ow!!! Three, two, one. Owwwww!!!"
19395,What the hell?
19396,This bubble allows you to view any past event from your life. It's got that new bubble smell.
19397,"Aw, I landed in a pleasant memory -- look at happy me and playful them."
19398,"Oh, I miss those bygone days of earlier this week. But I'm needed in a darker place."
19399,Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?
19400,"I've gotta find out who that guy is, but I need help. Someone like Bart, only smart. Lisa!"
19401,"Lisa, I'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. You wanna join me?"
19402,Bring it on.
19403,You're superior to me in every way!
19404,"Well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old Homer."
19405,What is it you want from me? Money? Weed?
19406,I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
19407,Who was it with?
19408,Right.
19409,"Kids, your mom is with another man, and I need you to help me find out who he is. Hm... is this really something I should show you kids?"
19410,"It's okay -- we're not really your kids. We're just representations of them, that you created in your mind."
19411,Really? Then if I created all this... that means I can have pizza anytime I want!
19412,"Hello, I'd like to order a pizza. Thirty-five minutes?!"
19413,See? That's where my memory stops. Who the heck is that guy?
19414,What if you just moved the bottle?
19415,All right. Let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.
19416,How can I get my memory to work?
19417,The mother of my children with the reason for my children!
19418,Noooo!
19419,Your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!
19420,My life is ruined.
19421,"Goodbye, cruel world."
19422,"And goodbye, Cruller World."
19423,"Wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then I'm not gonna do it."
19424,My life's flashing before my eyes.
19425,A life well-lived. Until last night. I guess I'll have to watch that now.
19426,"Hey, what's going on here?!"
19427,A surprise party?
19428,Are you kidding? The mother of my children with the reason for my children! This is gonna be the greatest party ever!
19429,Oh my God! It's like Christmas in December! Let's celebrate now.
19430,"Don't worry honey, I'll get you an ice pack. Where's the ice pack?"
19431,"So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid."
19432,"Oh, right."
19433,Oh my God! I'm not dead!
19434,This is great! I must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.
19435,What plan?
19436,Marge put so much work into that party. The least I could do is be surprised. If only I could forget what happened today.
19437,"Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--"
19438,"For the love of God, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce."
19439,"And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here."
19440,Hmmm... The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
19441,Oh yeah.
19442,Who's an angry dog? Who's an angry dog?
19443,"No, this is a moment I want to remember."
19444,Oh no! He's talking to that mailroom guy.
19445,"Listen carefully. I have taken your wife hostage. If you don't have a wife, I have kidnapped your brother. Nod if you understand."
19446,"Now, back away from Burns and I will let your dog live."
19447,Good. Now stop and dance like a happy prospector.
19448,Happier!
19449,Happier!
19450,Happier!
19451,Oh right. Just leave! But kick like a Rockette!
19452,We're free!
19453,"Set the table, Marge!"
19454,I can already taste those deep-fried pork chops!
19455,When you ask me that it's never good.
19456,"Marge, that was a joke!"
19457,"Well, if I'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap I love."
19458,"I think I'll miss you most of all, Captain Corndog's Schnitzel Palace. No tears, Homer."
19459,"Uh-oh, can't let Marge see this."
19460,A drive-up trashcan!
19461,This must be how the rich toss out their gold. And as long as I'm cleaning out the family chariot...
19462,Cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...
19463,"Hmm... ""Dispose of proper--"" This book is too hard."
19464,Now for a victory cigar.
19465,I can't stand to see a grown burger cry. We must rebuild Fast Food Boulevard!
19466,"I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where I can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. I say we rebuild the Fast-Food District -- bigger and better than ever!"
19467,"C'mon, Marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!"
19468,"Think tank, eh?"
19469,What? Not allowed to get one right?
19470,Die Hard Two!
19471,I live in that place!
19472,He's got my vote.
19473,Dear God. What have I done?
19474,"Oh my God, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!"
19475,That was the best milkshake ad I've ever seen. It makes me want a milkshake!
19476,"If you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!"
19477,"You too, Fred Thompson."
19478,Is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as I am?
19479,"Why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?"
19480,"No, no. This candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous."
19481,No. But you're close.
19482,What I did made the TV thing happen.
19483,I dig the Wig! I dig the Wig!
19484,"Lisa, being President is easy. You just point the army and shoot."
19485,"Oh, the Patriot Act is so terrible! The government might find out what library books I take out. What's next -- finding out what operas I go to?"
19486,"Don't worry, kids. These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm."
19487,I thought global warming would take care of it. Al Gore can't do anything right.
19488,Like which kid's their favorite! It's Lisa.
19489,Things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. It was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
19490,"Oh, it was a wonderful time. The Iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created ""Futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called ""Melrose Place""..."
19491,Your mother and I were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together.
19492,"We didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love."
19493,"Like all young people, I had a musical dream."
19494,A dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.
19495,But Marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world.
19496,Marge! Marge! Where are you?!
19497,"I was so depressed, I spent all my time in a bar."
19498,I had finally realized every rock star's dream...
19499,...hating being famous.
19500,A tale of two young outlaws in love...
19501,I had become diabetic from drinking too many Frappuccinos.
19502,"With the nineties drawing to a close, and the Sydney Olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled..."
19503,"And one moonlit night, I finally had fun at a mini-golf course."
19504,"Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart."
19505,"I mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach."
19506,"And once we were back together, I was too happy ever to grunge again."
19507,"Good, 'cause I'm parking at it right now."
19508,"For the next two hours, we'll be kid free. It'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall."
19509,That was the best Christmas ever.
19510,"Ah, the Tunnel of Love -- nothing gets a woman in your arms faster than scary robots and simulated privacy."
19511,Marge! Look over there!
19512,What if I told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?
19513,Even better -- a tale of ... One moment.
19514,"You'd think so, but..."
19515,They were the Bonnie and Clyde of their day. Their names were... Bonnie and Clyde.
19516,Even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. Why can't this be the Tunnel of Hockey Fights?
19517,"Happy Valentine's Day, and shut your gob."
19518,Loa...ner?
19519,Wow. This is the kind of car you see in commercials! How much am I paying for this?
19520,"Hm, it seems like a lot..."
19521,"Really? You people are idiots! That's the dumb-- What a stu-- I mean, that sounds fair."
19522,Look at you! Idiots!
19523,DRIVER OF A LOANER CAR / MUCH BETTER THAN A / DRIVER OF MY NORMAL CAR...
19524,None.
19525,"Hey boy, check out my new car!"
19526,Wanna take a ride with your old man?
19527,C'mon. C'mon. Oh c'mon.
19528,"What's the matter, son?"
19529,"Aw, don't give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to."
19530,"Son, I know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. But since then, I've really come to respect you. And unlike love, respect can't be bought."
19531,That's my boy! Now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!
19532,Now let's add the rear window defogger!
19533,Twister! Get down!
19534,"Mrs. Simpson, may I take you for an evening drive? Our loaner awaits!"
19535,Uh-huh.
19536,"Hello, you've reached the snug bug. What do you mean my car's ready?! Well you can keep it, 'cause I'm never giving up this one. Now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love."
19537,"That wasn't us, that was the transmission."
19538,"Yeah, I can't believe all those years I used to drive that old piece of... What the?!"
19539,My old car!
19540,So you're sure this baby'll make it out to the desert?
19541,"Sure! Why, what did ya have in mind?"
19542,"Well, we're gonna start by shootin' her full of holes. And then me and the boys are gonna have a little fun with her."
19543,I'll have you know I love this car as if it was my own child.
19544,"Sorry, Maggie."
19545,It's too much work. Why don't you come and get me?
19546,Just gimme a minute. But feel free to go nuts on me.
19547,"Oh boy, dinner time! The perfect break between work and drunk."
19548,"Wait, what's that smell? It's like a stalk of broccoli fell in a pot of boiling water."
19549,But I have all those old diets I still haven't finished.
19550,I'll bet no man would touch you.
19551,"It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!"
19552,Three please!
19553,Not quite.
19554,"Well, they say muscle weighs more than fat."
19555,What?! I'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
19556,"Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one."
19557,Wrong again.
19558,Work.
19559,"I, uh, I have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. Conservation of mass -- it's the law."
19560,I now declare you chips and salsa.
19561,"Oh, hey, kids! Um... What's up?"
19562,Well... I certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.
19563,Nothing!
19564,"Mmm, lamb."
19565,"C'mon, pick up, pick up! I know you're there."
19566,"Listen, baby. The other night was great, but it can never happen again. Oh, who am I kidding? I have to see you right now!"
19567,Pudding power activate!
19568,"Sweetheart, I didn't want to deceive you. I just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes."
19569,"Bart, it's me!"
19570,"I'm Lord Evilton from the ""Angelica Button"" books."
19571,"C'mon, boy. All the nerds are doin' it."
19572,Move or die!
19573,"Well, that's our book for the year -- I think we've earned some TV."
19574,"But kids, I want you in bed by three a.m."
19575,"Hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy."
19576,"Stop saying things, Bart! That's the TV's job!"
19577,That's right. Now I'll cut and you soak.
19578,Go-go or boring?
19579,"Son, while your mother and little mother are out, I'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret."
19580,I said secret.
19581,Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?
19582,Well wonder no more!
19583,"Thanks, son."
19584,Some of that is cow blood.
19585,"My Hindu friend, this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation."
19586,Where's our jerky?
19587,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You haven't seen our Power Point presentation. Bart?"
19588,Who could have done this?!
19589,This can only mean one thing.
19590,Flanders! You ate my jerky!
19591,I know you ate my jerky. Just like I ate your earthquake supplies!
19592,You stay right here.
19593,"Yeah, that's it, don't be shy..."
19594,"Enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits Homer Simpson... Hey, they're not sleepy. They're just turning fuzzy..."
19595,"I thought this might happen, so I brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow."
19596,"That wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal."
19597,You're on your own.
19598,When you cut 'em they multiply -- I can't fight that! Now let's take care of those raccoons.
19599,"Awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa. Aww... and they even share my views on parenting!"
19600,"Enjoy your jerky, little critters, and one day you'll grow up to be people. Bart, get some more jerky for man's new best friend."
19601,Lisa!
19602,Gimme that!
19603,I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
19604,I can't believe you were smoking. Do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?
19605,And a very wise fish he is!
19606,"Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid-- What the?"
19607,Uh... are you sure you want Lisa to keep dancing?
19608,Maybe you're drunk.
19609,Okay.
19610,Fatherhood hurts my brain.
19611,"Because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet. But you have to stop smoking -- including secondhand!"
19612,What'd you say?
19613,I thought you might have trouble with this. That's why I'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. Someone you'd never expect.
19614,"Come on out, boy."
19615,"Y'ello. She what?! Oh, my God! Well I'm gonna settle this once and for all! Meet me at the place we discussed."
19616,Wrong number.
19617,"Okay, Bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. Step one: we chuck the raccoon in there."
19618,Don't worry. I have a perfect way to conceal his identity.
19619,"See? Now go, boy!"
19620,"Not keys, cigarettes!"
19621,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
19622,"Hee-hee. Okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes..."
19623,This is my favorite family tradition -- ice cream after a botched recital.
19624,No!
19625,"Now practice preening to the crowd, El Guapo."
19626,"Come on, preen harder! Make them hate you! You feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!"
19627,"Dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?"
19628,"All right, that's it, pull over."
19629,I was having the most wonderful dream. I always wake up just before the good part.
19630,"I'll see you later, honey."
19631,"Homer Simpson. I know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. And I'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we Americans come together."
19632,"So I say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money."
19633,"Kids, marriage is like a car. Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. Now let's return to watching the news."
19634,I told her not to go into one of those.
19635,"Don't worry, you can stay with us. I'm sure Marge will be cool."
19636,Confederate degenerate?
19637,"Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks."
19638,"How could a man just abandon his family? By which I mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?"
19639,Where you going?
19640,"Wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a Dad too lazy to run away!"
19641,"And he has hair! Bart, get me my suicide axe."
19642,Later.
19643,Just sit still in my lap!
19644,Why you little--
19645,Get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!
19646,What?
19647,Lurleen's daddy comes back after thirty years and he's father of the year. Why can't I leave for thirty years?
19648,Well... it might be cold outside.
19649,"Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology. Well in that case I'm not going and I'm not staying. And I'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling."
19650,"Song's over, Dad."
19651,"Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."
19652,"Marge, my fringes are knotted again."
19653,"And remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and TV movies. Regular movies, don't hold your breath. But TV movies, the sky's the limit."
19654,Ten percent Lycra.
19655,"Ooo, I think he's a keeper."
19656,That's right.
19657,Don't you worry about Wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. We'll change a lot of things.
19658,"Yeah, what's the deal, loser?"
19659,"Son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--"
19660,Sold.
19661,See ya!
19662,"Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow."
19663,Doot de-doo de-doo do-doo de-doo... Strained spinach?! I'm not going to eat that -- it's yucky!
19664,Really? I guess I'll try it then.
19665,Mmm-mm-mm! I wonder if Maggie would like it.
19666,And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.
19667,Bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!
19668,"Okay, they bought it."
19669,Have you got Lou in your car?
19670,You guys come and get me as soon as they dump me back in the feedlot.
19671,"Ooh, Laughter House! With the world in the shape it's in, we could all use some comedy."
19672,Ready... for... pick up. Ready! For! Pick up!
19673,I'm a human being -- let me go!
19674,Hmm... that sounds like Tress MacNeille.
19675,Marge... kids... the things I saw. It makes me never wanna eat meat again...
19676,"Just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on Fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human."
19677,We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. The game makes me sick!
19678,"The real reason we Americans put up with sports, is for this..."
19679,"Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!"
19680,"Since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. What childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged."
19681,What could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?
19682,"All right, time to dig in. I brought everything we need."
19683,The food is all around us.
19684,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching."
19685,"Moleman! Come here, ya big bag-a skin! How the hell are ya, huh?!"
19686,"Yeah? No kidding? Well, that sounds like you're gonna have fun."
19687,Can I be Smithers?
19688,"Why, 'cause I'm fat?"
19689,"What, I'm going for a Shia LaBeouf thing. Not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... Shia LaBeouf!"
19690,Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.
19691,"Stupid charities, they think I'm gonna give them money? Save the Children? Save your breath. Take a hike, Sierra Club! Doctors Without Borders? Doctors without money! Hey, Greenpeace, you're not getting' a piece of my green! Robert Redford? Guess what -- a scissor runs through it."
19692,"""Film Festival,"" eh?"
19693,Where'd everybody go?
19694,"Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!"
19695,Who are you?
19696,What else?
19697,"Prove it, Hollywood!"
19698,"Hey, you're crying!"
19699,What?
19700,"We can't wait to see it, sweetie."
19701,A documentary?!
19702,"One, two, three... Another chute?!"
19703,Why... doesn't... life... give me... ladders?!
19704,You stupid kid! What if I walked in here barefoot?
19705,Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!
19706,Don't you dare post that review.
19707,"Not if I can help it! C'mere, beams! Come on! Hey, hey, where you going? Oh, there's too many!"
19708,No.
19709,I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.
19710,I know! Kinda miss it.
19711,Sit on a bench! Sit on a bench!
19712,"Well, this is kind of a cute outfit."
19713,What did you say?
19714,It's a medical condition!
19715,Who told you these things about me?!
19716,"I don't want to get mad, but I will!"
19717,That's it...
19718,It didn't have to go down like this!
19719,"Don't worry -- I'm ready for this. Bart, fetch ""The Defender."""
19720,That's where the food sleeps!
19721,"Wait a minute, I smell apples... cinnamon... crust... it's a pie!"
19722,Why would a robber make pie?
19723,"You're right, boy!"
19724,Mom!
19725,You're alive! And you baked a pie!
19726,I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
19727,"Mom, I can't believe you're here. You keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. You're just like that show ""Scrubs""."
19728,No thanks.
19729,"Every time you go, I feel abandoned. But not this time. I'm not gonna let myself get hurt."
19730,"That's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. In fact, I don't even want your pie."
19731,Well I'm not going to digest it!
19732,You left a hole in my heart that could never be filled. So I filled it with food. But I'm never full.
19733,"Oh, I don't even care."
19734,I'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
19735,No! I can't forgive you -- and I don't accept your tuck-in!
19736,"I feel terrible. My own mother reached out to me, and I rejected her. I'm gonna make her a card."
19737,Mom?
19738,Are you asleep?
19739,Asleep with your eyes open? Mom?
19740,Mom!
19741,My mother's dead.
19742,"Oh, this just gets worse and worse."
19743,I'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.
19744,She said I didn't suck?
19745,That bad. Wow.
19746,I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.
19747,"Apu, what do you think happens after you die?"
19748,"I mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? Does she know I feel bad about things I said?"
19749,That's it.
19750,A donut from the future!
19751,Woo hoo!
19752,"Aw, ma. You always knew just how to make everything all right."
19753,It works on so many levels.
19754,I've gotta get out of here!
19755,No...
19756,"Okay, this is it. I've got one last chance to make up for the things I said to my Mom. I will avenge you!"
19757,"I'm really glad you corrected me, Lisa. People are always really glad when they're corrected."
19758,"This is hard work. Isn't it, boy? Boy?"
19759,Why you little...
19760,"I always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me."
19761,"To spare, eh?"
19762,"Marge, your back is so sweaty. I'm starting to slip off."
19763,That's the highest point. And only fifteen minutes to go.
19764,Made it!
19765,"Mom, we didn't know each other very well. If we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. But even when you weren't around, I always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere."
19766,"Three o'clock. Goodbye, Mom. You're finally free."
19767,"Wait a minute... Mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. Mom! You used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?"
19768,"Hm, what could I make from those two things?"
19769,I'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.
19770,Wheee!
19771,Show me the law that says I can't! Wheee!
19772,I don't think so.
19773,"You can have her. To me, she's been nothing but trouble."
19774,Just what are you guys up to?
19775,The rainforest?! That's that thing Lisa likes!
19776,"You monster! On another subject, next Thursday I have to leave work early. I assume that's cool."
19777,"Mom, I'm so sorry. You just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. Well, if I get out of this I promise you I'll grant your last wish."
19778,Toss it down!
19779,"Thanks, boy."
19780,How am I ever gonna take on all those guys?
19781,God Bless America!
19782,"That'll do, brick, that'll do."
19783,Now I'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.
19784,"Well then, Mom, this was for you."
19785,Pee?!
19786,Bart's having girl trouble. You better go talk to him.
19787,I thought I was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.
19788,"Fine -- but you just bought yourself ""ear piercing"" and ""strange new feelings."""
19789,"Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. You know she works for Krusty now."
19790,"Uh, we'll stick with the coins."
19791,"Son... all hobbies suck. But if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time."
19792,Do you wanna collect coins with your old man?
19793,To your mother's purse!
19794,This is the first book I've ever finished reading or pushing things into.
19795,We missed one!
19796,"The one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. Son, we are getting that coin!"
19797,Wait!
19798,This is a classic nineteen seventy-eight Pizza Hut! Mmm... terrible.
19799,"Son, coin collecting's a lot like life. It stopped being fun a long time ago. But unlike life, I have a solution for this."
19800,"Okay boy, this is it. Five dollars!"
19801,Five dollars cash!
19802,Five hundred and one!
19803,"Objection, your honor."
19804,"Mr. Burns, my son and I have been collecting coins. It's really brought us closer together. That penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him."
19805,"Yeah. I'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. Do you have change for a nickel?"
19806,Aaaaannnnnd done.
19807,"You got it, boy."
19808,I'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
19809,Three-peat.
19810,I make that in a year.
19811,And if I don't show up?
19812,What a great job. And I could use a job right now.
19813,"Okay, I've set my trap. Now to scatter my cheese cubes and the rats will come. Condos! Affordable condos! Bail-jumpers welcome!"
19814,Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
19815,"Now, are you gonna come quietly, or do I have to..."
19816,"Now, let's think about this. If you shoot me, I won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. But someone may come after you. Probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. What I'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life."
19817,Flanders!
19818,"This case is ""in the bag."""
19819,"I sure could've, thanks to you."
19820,"Hey, Ned."
19821,I brought you something.
19822,He hands a greeting card to Ned.
19823,ANGLE ON: GREETING CARD
19824,It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
19825,"Ned, I never thought I'd say this, but we make a great team."
19826,"We should be bounty hunters together. You're kind and smart, I'm cruel and strong. Together, we're nothing. But together, we're the perfect bounty hunter."
19827,Sure. What is it?
19828,And you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
19829,"This taser is awesome. Finally, a practical use for electricity."
19830,Just warming it up. Now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
19831,No problem.
19832,Let's roll.
19833,"No, it looks cool!"
19834,Daddy's home! I brought you kids some stuff from work!
19835,"Here you go, son. Shell casings."
19836,Point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.
19837,Something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. A new chemistry set.
19838,The biggest one in town.
19839,Evidence that I love my little girl.
19840,"Marge, I brought you some flowers! A full dozen this time! No tricks!"
19841,"Yes, for now. I guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. Maybe we could order one of your cakes for Lisa's birthday."
19842,What'd you do that for?
19843,I'm not convinced.
19844,Still on the fence.
19845,Now I believe you.
19846,He'll be here sooner or later.
19847,"So, how 'bout a little stakeout music?"
19848,"Well, I like A.C.-D.C."
19849,DONE FOR FREE
19850,"Oh, you've gotta try it. This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. Then, BAM!"
19851,"You've got to roll it from the point. Here, let me show you."
19852,Now let it unfurl in your stomach.
19853,There he is!
19854,There's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!
19855,"Hey, it worked, didn't it? Okay smart guy, you're going in the bag."
19856,"Oh, wait. I left a sandwich in there."
19857,You know what your problem is? You haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
19858,I'll tell you what's over! This partnership!
19859,I can't take another word out of you!
19860,"I can't believe Flanders dumped me. Marge, do we have any more of your extra-long Twinkies?"
19861,"Marge, what's going on?"
19862,"Marge, I can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. But withholding sexy cake? I know we have to move past this, but I don't see how."
19863,"First, why don't you and I and the cake take a shower?"
19864,Hello! Hello? Anybody home? Hello?
19865,What have you done to my family?
19866,And how did you know I wouldn't be there?
19867,"Well, you'll never take me alive!"
19868,Forgot my keys.
19869,"I loved you, man!"
19870,You hang onto resentment like a Confederate widow.
19871,"Yeah, but you hold onto the big things! The point is, the more I got to know you, the more I got to like you."
19872,"So, it's gonna be like that, eh?"
19873,"I've got you, my friend."
19874,"Well, I'm--"
19875,Phew. Now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.
19876,"Aw, dammit!"
19877,Make it life and you've got a deal.
19878,"Oh, baby."
19879,"Thanks, Marge."
19880,Huh?
19881,This counts as a parent-teacher conference!
19882,Did he take the bait?
19883,"Hey, he went into a construction site!"
19884,Bart just keeps spinning around and around and around. What's his angle?
19885,We're doing laundry.
19886,No problem.
19887,"Eh, he won't get far. Not on the crappy breakfast I made for him."
19888,Our little boy has lost his mind. Let's get him.
19889,"Bart! Where are you, boy?! Don't worry, I won't strangle you."
19890,"Absolutely -- that unpleasantness in Ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and Bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds."
19891,"Is that him? No, it's just a bush. Clearly the work of Wirakocha, the trickster god."
19892,The computer says Bart's standing on the computer. All I see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! It doesn't add up!
19893,"Oh, uh, she's uh..."
19894,"Stupid shopping list, turning food into work. Bart!"
19895,"You better settle down, boy, or I'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera..."
19896,...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!
19897,"Hmmm, you make a good case. I'll take it!"
19898,You just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!
19899,I was gonna bet it on the dogs!
19900,That kid has become a Dennis-level menace!
19901,Bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
19902,I'm going to Moe's.
19903,I don't want your pity booze. I'll pay for it myself.
19904,"Oh, you look great."
19905,"Well Marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant..."
19906,"Stop it, both of you! Don't make me drive into that tree! You know I will!"
19907,"Lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals..."
19908,"Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!"
19909,You ruin everything! /
19910,Human garbage can to the rescue!
19911,"So at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs."
19912,"Talk louder? You bet. Naturally, I threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. But then Lenny said ""No, that was the new chair. That memo was two months old!"" So now I'm sitting on an orange crate. I never felt so--"
19913,Huh?
19914,"That's it, boy! You're going to bed without supper!"
19915,"If that boy thinks I'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! Stupid kids... think I'm made of hormones..."
19916,Give me back my newspaper!
19917,"For your information, the ""Daily Growl"" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is!"
19918,"How's the war going? We're winning, that's great! And our standing abroad? Fantastic!"
19919,"ALL AROUND THE SOMETHING WORLD,"
19920,"Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!"
19921,"This looks like a job for Captain Crazy! Up, up and away!"
19922,"Aw come on, gravity. You used to be cool!"
19923,Occupied!
19924,"Two hot chocolates, please!"
19925,No.
19926,"Y'know, I feel sorry for you, kid. Going back to that cold, loveless family."
19927,Take me with you!
19928,I'll be anything and everything you want! Don't leave me here with them!
19929,Nobody shuts out my blather!
19930,Were we ever that stupid?
19931,"Marge, I thought of a new thing -- it's called ""biking out."" It's a combination of biking and making out."
19932,"C'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it."
19933,Marge! I love this guy!
19934,"He rhymes! Oh, happy day!"
19935,I wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.
19936,"Marge Bouvier, will you not marry me?"
19937,"Then I now pronounce us ""just dating."""
19938,I love kissing you. I never want to knock it off.
19939,Knock it off!
19940,How dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! Bart! Don't you dare take your eyes off that Gameboy!
19941,Videogames -- the reason this generation of Americans is the best ever.
19942,"Hey, everybody pees in the pool!"
19943,That's it!
19944,"Eat gravel, hags!"
19945,I have the situation under control. The compass needle is pointing east.
19946,Uh-oh.
19947,How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
19948,I know -- I was hoping the number might be zero.
19949,"A really fun party? Full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? Doesn't seem like your kind of thing, Marge."
19950,"Eh, let my Dad enjoy 'em a little longer."
19951,"No, get two of your own."
19952,"No, I'm trying to get me drunk."
19953,"Well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you."
19954,"No, I'm talking to you, at this great party!"
19955,"Limbo? You mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? Either way, I'm in."
19956,Or you!
19957,SOMETHING SOMETHING LIMBO SOMETHING
19958,She's not strange! She's fun! And she doesn't get jealous when I talk to other women!
19959,Sushi fight!!
19960,These fish died for nothing!
19961,What a cute couple. She's gonna take him for a lot of money.
19962,Here we are.
19963,"Kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me."
19964,I'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.
19965,I'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.
19966,"Why Flanders, you rogue."
19967,"All Marge and I need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized ""Do Not Disturb"" sign."
19968,What?! But I have urges!
19969,"He's not talking, he's yelling!"
19970,"I never thought I'd say this, but... Stupid Flanders."
19971,Marge?
19972,Do you have a pineapple pizza?!
19973,This is all going so fast.
19974,"I came here once with Marge. Are you Marge, Sylvia?"
19975,I want you to be Marge.
19976,Marge?!
19977,Marge? Is that you?
19978,"Marge, what are you doing here?"
19979,"You better not be! I mean, great! We both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. Right?"
19980,"Oh, oh, oh, I have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here."
19981,I feel the same way about that lamp.
19982,Okay.
19983,"Listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. But you're goin' in the box."
19984,"Coming, Marge!"
19985,"Now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--"
19986,Kids?!
19987,That takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
19988,"Well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside Boggle?"
19989,"Hmm, all right. The trick is to ease them off--"
19990,"You're just as bad as me. And you used to be better, so that makes you worse! I don't think we can ever trust each other again."
19991,"Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare."
19992,I wish I'd never met you!
19993,Yeah. I missed her like five times.
19994,Forever? That would be awesome.
19995,And I suppose you and Maude will be coming along as well?
19996,"Marge, when I'm with you, I get that feeling like when I got that smart kid's report card by mistake. For a minute, I thought I had all A's. And that my name was Howard Simberg."
19997,"I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it."
19998,I hate other people's love.
19999,So that wasn't Marge's glider parked outside the motel five years ago! I'm getting out of this marriage while I'm still young and handsome.
20000,4 Ever. I couldn't even keep a promise I made to a tree. Maybe it's not too late! Maybe I can still save our love. If I just show her that carving...
20001,Saving our marriage!
20002,Help! Fat man hanging from a tree!
20003,I don't want to let go of our special carving!
20004,"Marge, I don't want to die with us mad at each other."
20005,"I know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, American history..."
20006,Awww.
20007,Now we wait for the river to freeze. If my theory of global cooling is correct.
20008,She blew it again! Woo-hoo!
20009,But we're married.
20010,How about R?
20011,Woo-hoo! Adult situations!
20012,Lemonade!
20013,"Six cups, please. And put it on my tab."
20014,"Keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only."
20015,"Fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! I'm going to Moe's, for beer! Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!"
20016,"Lisa, can Daddy borrow your bike?"
20017,"Hey Moe, gimme a--"
20018,Seymour... Edna asked me to talk to you.
20019,"No, this is about you. Edna wants to break up."
20020,Yeah.
20021,Yeah.
20022,"Look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. You have all your hair... unlike me. No kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... Oh, God, I hate my life!"
20023,"Exactly. You're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?"
20024,"Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead."
20025,And you will again. Because he isn't really dead. And now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...
20026,Y'ello!
20027,The gay guy?
20028,"Uh-huh, got it. Marge, I'm going to a hardcore gay club, and I won't be home till three in the morning!"
20029,You'll always have a special place in his heart!
20030,Anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?
20031,"Okay, everyone. Rotate one to your right."
20032,"Sweet Conclusions Break-Up Service. Oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented TenderDump System."
20033,I'll be there in thirty minutes... or your breakup is freeee!
20034,"Marge, if I had a hundred dollars for every customer I'd broken up, I'd have exactly this amount. 'Cause that's what I charge!"
20035,"I know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best."
20036,Who are you?
20037,"Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again."
20038,"Wow, so this is what this is."
20039,Surely some holds are barred.
20040,"Well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. Now if you'll excuse me..."
20041,"Hey, what's going on?"
20042,"Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money."
20043,"And these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment."
20044,I want you to put it all on my little girl. And parlay with the Asian kid.
20045,What is it?
20046,"She won! And like any prudent gambler, I know when to walk away: never!"
20047,"And when you win, I win. I'll explain that to you on your deathbed."
20048,You what?
20049,"Right, right. But will it happen this time?"
20050,Just be yourself.
20051,I wanna change my bet... I'm going against my daughter.
20052,Fine. I won't look you in the eye.
20053,Have I made the bet yet?
20054,"You know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental."
20055,No.
20056,Uh... the sun did that.
20057,"Well, sweetie, Daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. You'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. I hope you're not mad."
20058,You sure you're not mad?
20059,You sure you're not mad?
20060,"Mr. Teddy, can you ask Lisa if she's mad? What's that, Mr. Teddy? You're saying that you know women? And that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?"
20061,She's gone. Can you drive me home? I'm a little drunk.
20062,Lisa? Lisa?
20063,"Lisa, sweetie... please, look at your Daddy."
20064,Nooooooooooooooooo!
20065,Yessssssssssssssss!
20066,"Lisa's mad at me, and now she's using Marge's maiden name instead of mine."
20067,Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
20068,"Well, I had a little help from this guy."
20069,"Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you."
20070,Kitten calendar.
20071,What does it do?
20072,"Okay. What can I do for you? Please, I'm begging you!"
20073,But it's glowing.
20074,"Marge, I installed all the low energy bulbs!"
20075,Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
20076,"Milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum!"
20077,Sir? That's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an American kid.
20078,I'm really thirty-eight.
20079,"Hey, Bashir's great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn't last, but I bet they'd have a kid like him."
20080,"Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view."
20081,Oh my God. What can I do?
20082,But we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
20083,I guess I have no choice.
20084,"Here's the plan, Marge. You keep 'em talking. I'll be listening... and quietly judging."
20085,"Ah, interesting. Why just the other day I was reading that science is used to make bombs."
20086,Why don't I get us dessert?
20087,I made us a little cake.
20088,"Care to cut? Watch this, Lenny."
20089,What's the matter? Don't like the taste of freedom?
20090,"Shut up, old man."
20091,That's it! Ruin a perfect evening!
20092,I'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.
20093,"Okay, I'll apologize."
20094,"Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison."
20095,I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and...
20096,Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.
20097,So far so good.
20098,Marge! I was right! Everybody is whatever I think they are.
20099,I saw them unloading dynamite!
20100,"All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it."
20101,Now do Flanders!
20102,Nooooooo!
20103,Hm. Usually that ends the dream.
20104,The power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!
20105,Gotta prove the genie was right...
20106,Oh my God!
20107,I want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. And I thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.
20108,"Wait, wait, wait, wait... I read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. Is that true?"
20109,Praise be Oliver.
20110,We'll look it up in the Corona.
20111,"So... now that we're alone, um... death to America, right?"
20112,"Homer, why are you really here?"
20113,"Oh, look at that. We're out of almond paste. Don't get up. I'll grind the almonds myself."
20114,A computer!
20115,I'm in!
20116,Springfield mall?!
20117,They're gonna blow it up!
20118,"Just lis-ten! I'm grinding them now! Ow! My finger! Ooh, here comes the ambulance! My, you're a handsome fellow. Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson. We'll see to your finger. Why thank you."
20119,Ow! My finger!
20120,Everyone get out!
20121,Run for your lives!
20122,Run for your--
20123,Uh... stay where you are!
20124,Bart?
20125,"Boy, don't blow up this mall! It has the cookie store that gives free samples!"
20126,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
20127,What about the bridge?
20128,Did we really need a bridge there?
20129,I'll save you!
20130,That banner has really paid for itself over the years.
20131,"Oh no, no bees? Oooh, now who will sting me and walk all over my sandwiches?"
20132,Pfft! Knew it.
20133,Duh!
20134,What?!
20135,Bo-ring!
20136,Flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.
20137,Thank you.
20138,"I never dreamed the future could be scary. Let's go, Lisa. We've got some worms to save!"
20139,"Worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!"
20140,Animals can get sick?!
20141,You're the nerd.
20142,There's one on Lisa!
20143,"Hold still, sweetie. Daddy will kill it. And this time no screw-ups."
20144,"Marge, remember when we were talking about our worst fears?"
20145,And mine was snakes and yours was...
20146,"Really? I thought it was Lisa with a beard of bees. Well whatever, brace yourself."
20147,The secret is not to swallow the stingers.
20148,"They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart."
20149,"Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it."
20150,I knew it!
20151,I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
20152,Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?
20153,You and me?
20154,"Oh yeah, yeah, that's what I meant too. I have no... inclination..."
20155,Yep.
20156,And she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
20157,"Sweetie, I have a very special surprise for you."
20158,"Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment."
20159,"Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check."
20160,Are you guys dangerous?
20161,"A simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."
20162,"Don't worry, Lisa. Where else are they gonna go?"
20163,"When you're older, you'll miss these fun activities."
20164,"Uh, 'cause no one's making me. Buh-bye."
20165,Could've been. If we hadn't had kids.
20166,"Toldja, Marge. Tol. Dja."
20167,"Friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. Also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it."
20168,"Okay, honey. If it's that important to you, you said it."
20169,"Use as many big words as possible. I call ""computer."" Bart, you can have ""doorbell."""
20170,Hey! That was--
20171,We... I... You come up with an excuse!
20172,"If you say so, M'lord."
20173,"If you'll show me to your bathroom, I'd like to pretend to wash my hands."
20174,"When they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?"
20175,"Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?"
20176,"Oh, I get it. Here's ten bucks."
20177,What a racket.
20178,"Well, that's Bart for ya."
20179,"Seems like you and I are always talking about Bart, my son."
20180,"Oh, that. We were actually just going out for brunch and I got lost. But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy."
20181,I doubt it -- Friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.
20182,Wait!
20183,Is it some place I have to put on a tie?
20184,Is it a place I'd look overdressed if I did wear a tie?
20185,What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?
20186,"And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad."
20187,"Okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard."
20188,"No, he's ten days younger."
20189,If he's lucky.
20190,"The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's God. Well, God doesn't need his own special day!"
20191,"Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's. Completely different guy."
20192,"If I had won Class President, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now."
20193,"Yup -- back in high school, right before I met your mother. A simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation..."
20194,Guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
20195,Tears of a clown.
20196,"Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it."
20197,Angry nut coming through.
20198,"Hey, Vance?"
20199,"Great, thanks. Listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?"
20200,Please! You've gotta have some secret agony! I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.
20201,No. Yes.
20202,I'll just stick with my beer.
20203,"Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life."
20204,Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?
20205,So there's a chance I actually won! I've got to dig up that ballot box!
20206,Al Gore?
20207,Ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...
20208,I've gotta know.
20209,Lenny! Wake up!
20210,That's not why I'm here. Get dressed.
20211,California casual.
20212,The ballot box?!
20213,What will this box reveal? And what will I use this box for afterwards? Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes? I may never know.
20214,Woo-hoo!
20215,Woo-hoo!
20216,Woo hoo!
20217,", or woo hoo?"
20218,Yes! I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!
20219,"Wait a second. If I'd been Class President like I was supposed to, I'd be the one with the big mansion and the color TVs and the hot wife!"
20220,"Marge, I still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter."
20221,"That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!"
20222,Dondelinger!
20223,"Dondelinger! I should have been Class President, but you stole the election from me."
20224,"Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame."
20225,I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.
20226,"Virgin? What are you, a girl?"
20227,"Now, Dondelinger, I want some answers."
20228,You lie. You love me!
20229,I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.
20230,Huh? Who said that?
20231,Okay.
20232,"I would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his Saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. Why did fate do this to me?"
20233,Why? Why?
20234,"Come on, stir! I must see more!"
20235,"Marge, unlike C.P.R., this is something I must know."
20236,...Debbie Pinson.
20237,"Hey, Debbie, um... Wanna go to prom with me?"
20238,"I got the biggest lapels, the ruffliest shirt, and the most beautiful...girl?!"
20239,"Debbie, I forgot I have an English paper due on Monday. Would you read ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" for me and if you could write down how Boo Radley fits into the Southern Gothic tradition, that would be great."
20240,Homer Simpson. Class President.
20241,"A lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. May I have this dance?"
20242,"Sorry, Debbie. I hope you can find happiness without me."
20243,"I do! Oh, right."
20244,"Marge, the way I feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline."
20245,Sweet dreams.
20246,"Thank you, mysterious weirdo."
20247,I'm Class President.
20248,"How you doin', Dad?"
20249,"Honey, I'm home! Where are the kids?"
20250,"Uh, yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds. Blah, blah, blah."
20251,I wanna live in the sauce!
20252,Okay.
20253,"Oh, I get it. You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?"
20254,Are you kidding? We couldn't even convince you that Bruce Wayne is Batman.
20255,"Oh, come on! That millionaire playboy? He's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the Wayne foundation."
20256,"Oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce."
20257,"Oh, why would you bring me here?! It's like bringing Richard Nixon to the Watergate! Or Kevin Costner to Waterworld!"
20258,My own plaque! And one for Vice President Butthead! Cool.
20259,"Is that why you brought me here, spirits?"
20260,I guess that would be nice.
20261,Really? Sure.
20262,"Thanks, guys."
20263,"Hey, was there another plaque here before?"
20264,Now let's get something to eat.
20265,God no!
20266,"Ooh, that sounds like fun!"
20267,"...three, two, one. Happy New Year!"
20268,You're the government's problem now!
20269,Who taught you that language?!
20270,So you did learn something.
20271,"Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt."
20272,What a week.
20273,Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
20274,Great jokes make me hungry. I wonder what's in the pantry...
20275,Wait a minute...
20276,Wait a minute...
20277,Must be in the glove box.
20278,This was due two weeks ago! I'm not insured! For the first time in my life I'm financially responsible for my own actions!
20279,Uninsured! Uninsured!
20280,"I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
20281,Dear. Stupid. Insurance. Company. I. Meant. To. Mail this. On time. What. Do You. Mean. Too bad? Screw. You! Heh. Heh.
20282,"I won't be insured until three o'clock?! Okay, until then, I have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or I'm ruined."
20283,Oh no you don't!
20284,"Marge, I won't bore you with the truth. All I can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house."
20285,Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
20286,"Me too, baby. But we gotta get real."
20287,"Book club? That's the most stupid boring thing ever. Oh, thank you."
20288,Oh yeah.
20289,"I mean, nooo!"
20290,"Okay, I just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds."
20291,Kniiiife!
20292,Got it!
20293,"Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time."
20294,"So, plans for the weekend?"
20295,"Marge, are you mad I forgot to send in the payment?"
20296,"Baby, I hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause I'm about to file a claim."
20297,OH MARDI GRAS / OH MARDI GRAS / YOU SEE A LOT OF BOO-BIES...
20298,"Boy, where are my zydeco records?"
20299,"I know they do, but the Simpson Mardi Gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. And we spare no expense."
20300,This counts as that.
20301,"Ladies, how're you doing with the float?"
20302,No problem.
20303,"Marge, lighten up. Even Grampa's enjoying himself."
20304,"Ha, ha! Eat my food! Drink up my drink! Put your coat on my daughter's bed! I command you!"
20305,Fine. I'll invite him. But he has to wear the outfit I choose.
20306,"Hey, Flanders. Listen, uh... we're having a party..."
20307,"So, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not."
20308,"Because I have this magical thing called a Home Equity loan. I borrow all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. Sucker."
20309,"Fine, Mr. Skeptical. Give me back your beads."
20310,"Beads, please."
20311,"Marge, don't worry. It's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. They stopped calling us. In fact, everyone did!"
20312,Oh man. Who'd think the first day of Lent would be such a bummer?
20313,"Listen, you! When you gave me that money, you said I wouldn't have to repay it till the future! This isn't the future! It's the lousy, stinking now!"
20314,That poor man. Is he okay?
20315,"Don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. I ripped all the copper wire out of the walls."
20316,Did I what now?
20317,Goodbye.
20318,"Let's go, kids. I can't watch any more."
20319,"And on the zillionth day, God created hugs."
20320,And it was gooood.
20321,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. I left a little uh ""surprise"" upstairs for the new owner."
20322,HE SAVED OUR ASS!
20323,No problem. Just let Sir Fix-a-lot slay this chore.
20324,Next problem.
20325,It's so beautiful. No two are exactly alike. Though many of them are very similar.
20326,"I'm back, baby!"
20327,"He what?! Flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! You lounge around in your Egg MacMansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!"
20328,"Some friend you are. The minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. You'd better just pray I don't find out where you live!"
20329,Bart! Don't forget to turn the chicken!
20330,"Yeah, you'd treat her right."
20331,"Oh, right -- like ""Dateline"" did to you!"
20332,We live in a house that is trying to kill us.
20333,"Who is this ""Dad"" you speak of, Lisa Simpson?"
20334,Yes.
20335,...Squeaky stair here... scary portrait there...
20336,Poltergeist in the closet...
20337,Why you little...
20338,I'm the victim here!
20339,Kadiddlehopper.
20340,Fine. You're mad. What are you gonna do about it?
20341,Fine. I'll get another neighbor to buy the house and let us live in it!
20342,"Flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on Christmas, would you?"
20343,"It is me, Jesus!"
20344,I have come from my workshop in the North Pole to say: don't evict the Simpsons!
20345,It was... um... do you have a computer nearby?
20346,He's nailing something to our door.
20347,"Ew, that's gross."
20348,"Don't worry, Marge."
20349,"According to this chapter book, we have a secret weapon: ""Evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over."" Finally, a practical use for my father."
20350,I'm using you!
20351,My own devices!
20352,"Hey, Flanders. You can't evict us because a senior's living here now."
20353,Will you kids knock it off? I'm trying to watch badminton!
20354,"Well, I guess we can take a quick walk. We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf."
20355,"So, after I paid for the ice cream cones, I said ""thank you"" and was on my way."
20356,"I know it seems that way, because I'm such a vivid storyteller. Now here's another story called ""Bart's Mistake."" We were walking home when"
20357,How could this have happened?
20358,"Well, I can't compete with that!"
20359,"Honey, don't cry. It could be worse -- at least it's not raining!"
20360,"See, I told you, it's not raining. So we're just homeless."
20361,"Kids, if you get lost, remember where we are: seventy-five beds from that wall, and a hundred beds from the crazy guy."
20362,That's not true. You have bug bites you can scratch.
20363,"Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never abuse our friendship again."
20364,Never! Hooray for Stupid Flanders!
20365,I really hate this neighborhood.
20366,"Yeah, right! And I'm married to Wonder Woman!"
20367,"No, I'm gonna see it first!"
20368,My space toy!
20369,We'll be talking about this together for years!
20370,I finally feel like part of a family!
20371,"Don't worry, honey, I'll be your ""seeing-eye Homer."" We're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... Um, I'm gonna take my break now."
20372,Wolves are taking all our women.
20373,You just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
20374,Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
20375,"Aw, rats in the kitchen. Just like that delightful movie I taped in the theater."
20376,"Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy."
20377,"Hmmm, this is good."
20378,"Good, but not great. I'll go get some rat poison."
20379,"No, you stupid dog -- that's Maggie's bunny!"
20380,Not in front of the poison man!
20381,"Whoever's biting me, stop it!"
20382,Why did I bring the baby and the dog to the poison store?
20383,How am I gonna get us all across this river?
20384,A boat!
20385,"Oh, we're too heavy."
20386,"Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby."
20387,Can't someone help me with this puzzle?
20388,Professor Frink! Help me figure this out!
20389,Yo! Over here!
20390,"Great time to nap, Einstein!"
20391,"Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. First I row Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. Then I row back alone, take the poison over and bring Maggie back. Then I take the dog over, come back, get Maggie, row across, and before I know it, I'm back at home!"
20392,Were you listening at all?
20393,"Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of God. And I'll be watching you too, in case God's busy making tornadoes or not existing."
20394,I see you! I see you!
20395,I see--
20396,Catholics!
20397,Give me my baby back!
20398,'Cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. Now give her back so I can take her home to my rat-infested house!
20399,"Come on, lady, have a heart. I screwed up! I'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!"
20400,"Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie."
20401,"Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun."
20402,Told you there was no way I would do it.
20403,Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.
20404,Huh?
20405,"Um... No problem, sweetie."
20406,Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
20407,You cool it -- I'm hungry!
20408,"No, Marge. You're the most giving person I know. Besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne."
20409,"You told me something, but I wasn't listening!"
20410,"Fair enough! Kids, let's practice."
20411,Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
20412,"That was good, but Lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm."
20413,Maybe it's beef stew!
20414,Hot tubs!
20415,"Guys, what's it like?"
20416,I want to buy your fanciest hot tub!
20417,"Please, can I get it, Marge? Please? Please?"
20418,"Beats me. / I'unno. / Please, please, please!"
20419,I'm on it.
20420,Go back to your day spas!
20421,Interesting proposal. Now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.
20422,"Hey, Flanders! Why don't you join us? Afraid you'll get your moustache wet?"
20423,Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.
20424,"Hey, what happened to the bubbles?"
20425,"Oh Dad, I never knew you had dreams, or emotions."
20426,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?"
20427,"Okay... ""Pitch in the Negro Leagues,"" I can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it..."
20428,Have one more beer at O'Flanagan's Pub... We'll do that one!
20429,This place is in Ireland?!
20430,Lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!
20431,"Sir, I brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar."
20432,Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!
20433,"You okay, Dad?"
20434,"Oh, I miss her."
20435,"Well, Dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an Irishman?"
20436,"Hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? How about you, Greensleeves? Irishmen love to get drunk."
20437,"Who are you, stuttering Fonzie? What about you, bicycle pants?"
20438,Why you...
20439,Uh-oh.
20440,Our first sale!
20441,Our first refund.
20442,"Yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! There's Sully, and Mack, Jimmy D. and Jimmy B.! What can I get ya, boys -- the usual?"
20443,We are so screwed!
20444,Ireland doesn't like pubs anymore. It's as if Danish people stopped liking sleek modern design.
20445,"Well, we need help. Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm."
20446,"Moe, something terrible has happened! The Irish have become hardworking and sober!"
20447,"So, what can't people do in modern Ireland?"
20448,People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!
20449,"Moe, you were right!"
20450,"Well, ""Da,"" it looks like all your ""der"" have come ""ter."""
20451,I can't tell if those are questions or statements.
20452,"Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out. America is the New York Yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand."
20453,It was apt.
20454,"Let me say I've always admired the Irish. Knute Rockne, Larry Bird, and especially Mr. Potato Head."
20455,"But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?"
20456,"So I hope you'll forgive two well-meaning Americans for trying to take Ireland back to the good old days of ""Angela's Ashes."" Thank you."
20457,"Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!"
20458,Suckers!
20459,"Reverend Lovejoy? You deliver pizza now? But we didn't order a pizza. But you forgot the pizza anyway. Marge, the pizza place screwed up again."
20460,"You don't get it, Padre. My old lady and I have a thing goin' on. We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real."
20461,I need that paper quick!
20462,Why you little bastard...
20463,"Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world."
20464,"Marge, this time I'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. Let's get out of here!"
20465,"Hello. It's me, Lance Romance."
20466,Your first mission is to look out the window.
20467,"Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?"
20468,"Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes! Now, back to your cold, airless tomb."
20469,How'd you check?!
20470,"Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge."
20471,Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.
20472,Chocolate.
20473,What if we...
20474,"But there is, Marge! The first two letters..."
20475,Why not?
20476,"Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla."
20477,"No matter what I do, Marge yells at me. If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?"
20478,What's going on? What's with all the darkness? Hello? Marge! Where am I?
20479,What the? I'm chained up like a common bicycle!
20480,Who would do this to me?! It would have to be someone who could afford a chain.
20481,But I have to marry Marge!
20482,"Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression."
20483,I miss you so much.
20484,"You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!"
20485,"To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful."
20486,What the?
20487,Whose side are you on?
20488,Malge! Ahmiss oo. Ahmiss oo so mug...
20489,"I'm gonna say this for the last time: Bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny."
20490,"What's fun about fire ants? They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic."
20491,"Thank you, that's very... More sarcasm."
20492,Just see that my fiancée Marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
20493,Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date.
20494,"Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. You always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is I. With each marriage I get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you."
20495,"I miss you. I miss the kids. God help me, I even miss your sisters."
20496,"I'm not sure what happened. I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn."
20497,Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?
20498,"I'm sorry, honey. I wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding."
20499,A rocket ship wedding cake -- just what I always wanted!
20500,I love to see this!
20501,"This is no time to pat the bunny, Maggie. Daddy's watching a very important Mid-Atlantic Hockey League Conference Semi-Final do-over game."
20502,"Stop him, Babando!"
20503,"I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends."
20504,Wha-wha-what's the score?!
20505,"The score, damn you!"
20506,I will never... know... the score!
20507,"Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage."
20508,Yes?
20509,"That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?"
20510,He is pretty good with her.
20511,Look Marge! It's just what you want. Me spending the day with Muggsy.
20512,"Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high."
20513,"Impossibly high. Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!"
20514,Not even heated up. Typical dog.
20515,"This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning."
20516,"Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder."
20517,"Moe, what are you doing?"
20518,"Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?"
20519,"Aw, her first enabling."
20520,Hello Maggie... hello Maggie.
20521,"Ooh, Maggie made some new friends."
20522,"Aw, burrowing your head into your Daddy. A sign that my baby is happy and confident."
20523,"I can too! ""There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."
20524,There you are!
20525,Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
20526,How would I know?
20527,"I have not! Oh right, you think I do."
20528,"Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about."
20529,"In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?"
20530,"Man oh man, slap a ring on that!"
20531,"Here we are, Maggie. That park you love..."
20532,See you when the moon comes out.
20533,"Man, that made me thirsty."
20534,"I'll save you, Maggie!"
20535,I'm telling!
20536,Now what?
20537,"Aw, sweetie, you saved me. Well, I promise that wherever you go in this world, I will always be there for you."
20538,"Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me."
20539,"Whatcha watchin', honey?"
20540,And I'm good at beginnings.
20541,Not a thing in the world.
20542,"Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile."
20543,"Well, I'm glad they suspended Milhouse. He's a bad influence on you."
20544,"You know, I think Milhouse is ""El Barto."" Hmmmm."
20545,"And now, you're gonna visit your Grampa while I park around the corner and take a nap."
20546,Don't shake your fist at me!
20547,Boy.
20548,"Look, man, I don't want any trouble. C'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. Leave me alone, okay?"
20549,"Oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name."
20550,"Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do."
20551,We done here?
20552,"Yeah, busboys get all the chicks."
20553,"Son, girls come and go. But you'll always have your family."
20554,"I know, I know."
20555,Big deal! I could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.
20556,'Ut 'uz it 'ay?
20557,"Oh man, I love Saturdays!"
20558,"Oh, this is great, honey. Thanks for telling me about it. I hope you don't mind I invited Lenny."
20559,"Ooh, lamb-kebab!"
20560,"Ooh, chicken-kebab!"
20561,"Ooh, fire-kebab!"
20562,Water!
20563,Why... you... little...!
20564,"Burn, Barty, burn!"
20565,Is it 'omplimentawee?
20566,"It is? 'Ey every-ody, 'eck out I 'ompliment!"
20567,"I held up two, for ""peely!"""
20568,"Well, at least I can eat again!"
20569,"Mmm, cherry."
20570,Too much cherry!
20571,"Ooh, lemon. That'll stop the cherry."
20572,"Doctor, why is this happening to me?"
20573,I can't eat tacos?! Oh my God -- what day of Mayo is it?
20574,Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
20575,I still taste over-tones of pink!
20576,Hm. It feels like food. But it has no flavor whatsoever.
20577,What else do they got?
20578,"Man, who comes up with this stuff?"
20579,Don't have one.
20580,"Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!"
20581,"Oh, come on, relax, I won't embarrass you."
20582,"Uh... can I work it off? Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."
20583,"OH, I'M BIG AND YELLOW / AND I'M SERVIN' JELL-O / IF YOU'RE A FELLOW AND YOU WANT SOME JELL-O / YOU'D BETTER BELLOW / HEY, BIG GUY / GIMME SOME JELL-O"
20584,"Up-bup-bup. No Jell-o for you, Bart -- it'll keep you up at night. Like last week when you crawled into bed with me and Mommy?"
20585,Sure is hot back here.
20586,"Hey, there we go."
20587,"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."
20588,"Buddy, I'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation."
20589,"Well, I know when I'm not wanted. Am I wanted?"
20590,"Hi, Homer Simpson. Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks."
20591,"Wow, he's terrified of you."
20592,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? Isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?"
20593,Well I hope your son enjoys being driven around by the President of the United States.
20594,"Yeah, you don't see many presidents doing that. Maybe L.B.J. -- you know, at the end."
20595,"I don't have to ""helicopter"" Bart -- I've got a backup plan called ""Lisa."""
20596,"Oh my God, my son's a loser and my daughter's a loner. Way to go, Marge!"
20597,"Marge, where have you been?"
20598,No time. I'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
20599,That makes sense. Movin' on.
20600,"...if we don't get more involved in their lives, Bart and Lisa are gonna be failures. Failures who work for... Noah!"
20601,Aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?
20602,"If Marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! Help me, mayonnaise!"
20603,Look at all these helicopter parents. I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.
20604,There's no future in that!
20605,A thousand dollars?! That's what my house is worth!
20606,"Time to take control of my son's life. Let's see, what can he build..."
20607,Too obvious.
20608,Gotta be something from Earth.
20609,You're no help.
20610,Perfect!
20611,I did it! I helped my son! Helicopter Homer away!
20612,Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!
20613,"Lisa, I found this book in the ""What's Wrong With My Daughter"" section of the bookstore."
20614,It tells you how you can get popular.
20615,"Sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the Continental Congress. Dolphins swim in cliques. Those are my two examples."
20616,"And to show you how this book works, I will demonstrate on some rats..."
20617,"Let's try what chapter seven calls ""Un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. Hey, Lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus."
20618,"See, it works. And un-sults are just the beginning. There's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... Hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?"
20619,"Ooo, I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean everyone everyone. Hope you don't mind."
20620,"And that, my dear girl, is called the Toledo Take-back."
20621,"I see. Well, maybe you're not ready for this book. It is more of a big girl thing."
20622,Enough to build a Washington Monument.
20623,What cologne are you wearing? None of your business! Now we'd like our Washington Monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
20624,What do you mean? And who are you?
20625,"But, you..."
20626,What's the hardest model there is?
20627,"Attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. My son and I are going to build Westminster Abbey!"
20628,"Hey, how hard can it be? All we have to do is follow the directions."
20629,"Marge, the boy and I will be making Westminster Abbey."
20630,"But first, as part of ""Operation Popularity,"" Lisa and I are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard."
20631,Brittany and Kaitlin are here! Where's my spray-on tan?
20632,Ant poison? Why do I always read the labels after?
20633,"Ladies, we've got it all. Rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys."
20634,I am such a great parent to both my kids.
20635,"Hello, little girl, who do you belong to?"
20636,"Hey boy, why don't I do that for you?"
20637,All the other parents are doing it for their kids. Now stand back and I'll take it from here. A little further back.
20638,"Naw, that kinda creeps me out."
20639,Must finish Poet's Corner... or Bart will work for Noah... with his hot mom...
20640,"That's not Henry the Seventh, it's Henry the Sixth! Stupid, stupid, stupid!"
20641,Geoffrey Chaucer?! What are you doing here?
20642,Anne of Cleves!
20643,Oscar Wilde?
20644,But that makes no sense!
20645,Shut up!
20646,"Whatever happened to ""boo?"""
20647,Now we could smash the real Westminster Abbey so it looks like this.
20648,There are no flights to London till five!
20649,"Yes! Yes! In your face, losers! This helicopter is taking off!"
20650,I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.
20651,I H-8 this?
20652,"Yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing I can do as a parent is simply check out."
20653,"Lisa, a light bulb is either on or it's off."
20654,That's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.
20655,"I tried to fix the kids' lives, but instead I led them to rich and rewarding personal decisions of their own."
20656,That mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
20657,It was stuffed with cash!
20658,Oh yeah.
20659,I feel like I've died and gone to Hell.
20660,"I can't understand that math reference, because I went to Springfield Elementary!"
20661,"We can't afford to move to Waverly Hills! Their house prices have commas in them. As it is, our lawn is just green-painted cement."
20662,"Oh, elementary school friends -- those are forever! You're always gonna be friends with Milhouse. STAND BY ME / OH, STAND BY ME..."
20663,"I need to rent an apartment in the worst part of Waverly Hills -- the crappier, the better."
20664,Ahso sheepay to you.
20665,I can't afford this place -- it's way too fancy.
20666,Sometimes there's not a train going by.
20667,Four walls? I was thinking more of something in a two or three.
20668,"Yeah, um, well, I'm looking at a lot of murder sites right now. Where's the bedroom?"
20669,Tempting. Tempting. Where's the bathroom?
20670,I'll take it!
20671,WAVERLY HILLS / THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE / SQUATTING IN WAVERLY HILLS. / WAVERLY HILLS / GET EDUCATION FRAUDULENTLY / MOOCHIN' OFF WAVERLY HILLS.
20672,Ha! I can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. How I despise them.
20673,"Heads. I mean, tails. I mean, on its side."
20674,That's not enough.
20675,Thank you.
20676,"Goodnight, Marge."
20677,When do I get to move back home?
20678,The heat is off. The hissing from the radiator is a snake.
20679,That's another twenty or thirty years.
20680,Where am I?
20681,That was great. You mind if I use that at work?
20682,"Well, I love to play, but I'm not very good. Also, I always forget to cash my chips back in for money."
20683,You make words into dudes.
20684,Your hair smells nice!
20685,S'open!
20686,Marge! I'm glad you came. There's a kegger down the hall. We can go as soon as I desecrate this corpse.
20687,"Eat butt, skyboy-ninety-four! I'm sorry, Marge. Where are my manners? Did you want to taunt my kill also? Press the X button."
20688,I'll get us some brewskies.
20689,"Cup, m'lady? Or would you care to funnel it down thy throat?"
20690,Foam wasn't spilt in a day.
20691,"Two, actually. Twins."
20692,I was an astronaut for a little bit. So many rules.
20693,Listen... I got a place down the hall.
20694,Woo-hoo!
20695,We're not the only ones having a good time.
20696,Maybe you could come over again. I'll cook you my special microwave burritos. I stop the oven when the middle is still a little bit frozen.
20697,"How 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?"
20698,Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...
20699,Be sure to dig around in the gunk.
20700,Why can't I have it now? You got your present here. Basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
20701,Where are my videogames? My X-box?! My Wii?!
20702,"You know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife."
20703,What movie?
20704,I went to a movie.
20705,I drove.
20706,Sometimes I think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
20707,"Thank you, Friendo."
20708,"But, I thought... you said..."
20709,I can't leave my bachelor pad! My bros'll miss me!
20710,Why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
20711,"What do you think, Marge? Maybe we've outgrown our first apartment."
20712,"C'mon, boy! Be cool!"
20713,Be cool or you're grounded!
20714,"Marge, I need some bribe money!"
20715,"Thanks, Marge. But don't forget, there's still gonna be a civil suit."
20716,"Well, I may be playing a tree but at least I'm getting my face out there."
20717,"Hey, there's no way I could ever be as good as that guy."
20718,You're not suggesting... murder.
20719,"Whatever you say, sweetie."
20720,A prop knife!
20721,"He who laughs last, laughs dead."
20722,Why does everyone around here talk that crazy talk?
20723,"Well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks."
20724,"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more / By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis... uh, To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow... today's Tuesday, so that would make it Friday, and then, uh... Shakespeare!"
20725,Conrad Birdie? Coming here to Sweet Apple?!
20726,"""Dammit, Morpheus. Not everyone believes what you believe."""
20727,I can't wait for the reviews!
20728,Who the hell is Banquo?
20729,Wouldn't it be easier if I just took acting lessons?
20730,That's inspiring. What's that from? X-Men 2?
20731,Mac-who?
20732,Why do they write a new review of this play every single day?
20733,"No, dear. I'm a man, dear."
20734,KILLING MAKES ME HUN-GRY
20735,EATING MAKES ME THIRS-TY
20736,DRINKING MAKES ME SLEE-PY
20737,"Well, at least you can't nag me anymore."
20738,Ow!
20739,It's my moment.
20740,"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more."
20741,Me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
20742,"Goodbye, fat me."
20743,"I don't know how you put up with all these kids, Toohey. If I were you there'd be a lot of strangled babies."
20744,"Can you help me out? I need change for a dollar. Oh, I also need a dollar."
20745,Great! Do you want to see me naked?
20746,"Let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. Lisa?"
20747,"Great. Okay. Marge, go."
20748,You? Awesome. Next.
20749,"Eh, they can go to Hell. Bart?"
20750,"Time's up! Okay, Maggie: ""suck, suck,"" that takes us to... me."
20751,Some Hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie!
20752,Fine. I'll give back the Oscars I stole from the lobby.
20753,Do you want the Golden Globe?
20754,"I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: ""Yo, hot dog man!"" ""Yo, peanuts!"" Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what ""yo"" means?"
20755,"Finally, the answer to my problem. What do you do?"
20756,"Hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones."
20757,Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
20758,"Yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate ."
20759,"Oh, that song's a little on the nose. Can we do it to David Bowie's ""Heroes?"""
20760,This montage sounds really exhausting. How 'bout I just do a walking around sad montage?
20761,A montage of me turning a ragtag Little League team into state runners-up?
20762,"Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken?"
20763,"Ten thousand one, ten thousand two... aaaand fit."
20764,Was that Tobey Maguire?
20765,But how will I keep from overeating?
20766,Found this on the roof.
20767,"What'd you think, kids?"
20768,Your other hand.
20769,"This life is the greatest. I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and I get to hire my friends."
20770,A lot of things come and go in life. But not fame and fitness.
20771,Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
20772,But you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
20773,He's gone.
20774,One cheese cube couldn't hurt.
20775,"Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one."
20776,It's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes.
20777,Don't look at me. Don't look at me!
20778,You. You watch.
20779,"Well, one thing's for sure: I'm not Everyman."
20780,Oh Marge! I'm ready for some lovin'!
20781,"Marge, speak to me."
20782,"Nag, nag, nag."
20783,"Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?"
20784,Uh-oh.
20785,"How ya doin', man?"
20786,I'm right here! I've been here all along!
20787,What happened is you left! Who did you leave me for? Tell me. I can take it.
20788,I knew it!
20789,Just you and me?
20790,That could work.
20791,You just said both those things to me.
20792,I'm so cold.
20793,"Okay, now I'll be the dog and you be the daddy."
20794,"Okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. Show me some of Bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades."
20795,I'm not asking for A's. Just incompletes.
20796,It will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this.
20797,"I said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?"
20798,You're the first teacher that ever got me.
20799,No... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
20800,"Hm, I don't know -- kernels are kind of big."
20801,"When you say ""teacher,"" do you really mean ""parent?"""
20802,"Great. Go nuts. But remember, we never had this discussion."
20803,"The one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! Ohhh."
20804,Woo hoo! There's no better violence than self-inflicted violence!
20805,"Not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly."
20806,Maybe.
20807,Ask him.
20808,"Ah yes, filthy, but obscure. With a subtle scatological undertone."
20809,"Pay the man, boy."
20810,"Now listen, son, I know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. Do it at the schoolyard. Someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass Joe Biden."
20811,Kill! Kill. Kill.
20812,"Ultimate Punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. Studies have shown your mother is right."
20813,It wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! Frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a Bavarian castle!
20814,I couldn't help it! She knew my one weakness -- that I'm weak!
20815,"Five, six / Who's got tix?"
20816,What'd I miss?
20817,"Yeah, Marge. He'll knock your block off. Your beautiful block."
20818,"Listen: of all the crazy things I've ever done, this is the craziest. And you're doing it."
20819,"Watch your language, moron."
20820,How can I control her?! I have nothing to withhold!
20821,"We've gotta get Marge some professional training. Carl, do you know heavyweight champ Drederick Tatum?"
20822,"Well, I... uh..."
20823,I'll bash him with this book!
20824,Marge... I bet we've got ten minutes till the kids wake up.
20825,There certainly is.
20826,Marge Simpson reporting for duty!
20827,"Uh, Moe, I have a confession to make: I'm just Homer dressed as Marge."
20828,"Well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night."
20829,"Marge, I tried my best to talk you out of this. But since you're going through with it, I beg you, just stay out of his way and don't get hurt."
20830,"I'll save you, Marge!"
20831,Woo hoo!
20832,"Ooo, ooo, can I go, Marge? Can I? Can I?"
20833,No holds barred.
20834,The math checks out!
20835,"Well, we're not going out to help him. We have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!"
20836,How do I know you're not a muncher?
20837,I can't make sense of that muncher talk!
20838,Really?
20839,Then we must keep this boy safe from harm!
20840,Better call Dr. Hibbert.
20841,You mean tell her I love her? Or I meaning you?
20842,I'll just high-five her.
20843,"Now remember, no loud noises. Oh man, that breeze feels good!"
20844,To the panic room!
20845,To the panic room store!
20846,Another politician who can't keep his promises.
20847,"Well, this day can't get any crazier."
20848,"Well, well, well."
20849,Who's an unproductive worker now?
20850,Got your nose.
20851,Why you...
20852,"I think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?"
20853,"Ooo, mouth."
20854,Woo hoo! An unattended tap! Like takin' beer from a baby!
20855,Helllp me!
20856,Help me or kill me!

20862,I RECOMMEND / OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND / BARTENDER MOE SZYSLAK!
20863,SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO WORSE!
20864,"Of course I do, Marge. Can you still love a man who's half-beer?"
20865,To love!
20866,Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...
20867,Can't we just all supervise ourselves?
20868,Woo-hoo! Our boss is our best buddy!
20869,Yeah!
20870,"Hey Carl, why aren't you high-fiving?"
20871,"You see, he hasn't changed!"
20872,"Hey Carl, look how I messed with the names on the softball sign-up sheet. It's delicious! You know how Smitty's name is Smitty? Well, not anymore -- I changed the ""m"" to a--"
20873,"...to a ""p"". Spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks."
20874,"Oh, well... I didn't know that."
20875,"Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is?"
20876,"Not an option, big fella. Either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'!"
20877,"Oh fine, I guess I'm at your beck."
20878,Nooooooo!
20879,Calendar! Oh my God! I forgot to move Carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.
20880,His astrologist will show up at the same time as his astronomer! This is not good! This is not good!
20881,"Marge, would you mind if we just cuddle?"
20882,"Stupid Carl... ""Update the phone list, Homer!"" ""You put my contact lenses in backwards, Homer!"" I'm sorry, honey."
20883,"Leave me alone, you two!"
20884,"Honey, I know it's been a rough couple of weeks. But I booked us a night this Saturday, at a very romantic hotel."
20885,"Ocean view, obstructed."
20886,"All right, I put in a hundred-hour work week, but I took a power-nap while I was driving us here and now I'm rarin' to go!"
20887,Lemme try.
20888,"""LICK... EYES."" Um, I'll try again. ""SPANK... HAIR."" What the? ""WHISPER INTO... ASS."" This game sucks!"
20889,We're gonna be snore in the morning...
20890,"Okay. Kiss me, baby! Kiss me like a frog in a fairytale!"
20891,"I'll make it up to you, Marge, I swear."
20892,"Actually, those were Carl's shirts."
20893,"Hey, it's not like I want to go. Go, go, go!"
20894,"Okay, Fission Week kicks off on Monday with a reception by the International Proton Council. Word is, protons are the new electrons."
20895,I will! Edamame?
20896,French Nuclear Commissioner Etienne Ducharme.
20897,But I have to get back to Marge.
20898,Bonjour.
20899,Where I should've been all along...
20900,In Springfield.
20901,"Oh I don't think so! You know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? She's the first lady of France, Carla Bruni!"
20902,"If you fire me, I'll call President Sarkozy and he'll be all over you like Truffaut on Hitchcock."
20903,You wouldn't dare!
20904,Oh wouldn't I? Just listen.
20905,"Allo, you are getting cozy with Sarkozy."
20906,"Okay, Okay, you win!"
20907,Hey Ned.
20908,"Marge, I believe we have a little unfinished business. Come with me!"
20909,"Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?"
20910,Classic.
20911,Gotta leave early to beat the traffic. Now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. For crying out--
20912,"I hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon!"
20913,I can't take it anymore!
20914,It's daddy's turn!
20915,Stomp it! Crush it! Kill it!
20916,"Finally, some peace and quiet."
20917,Why do my actions have consequences?
20918,"Now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm."
20919,Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.
20920,What happened?
20921,Where's the hooch?
20922,A female that gives birth to alcohol.
20923,"Well, uh... it's got a rich mash base and a sense of danger. And I detect notes of elderberry, tobacco, oak, no, poison oak... and hints of game."
20924,Lisa! Lisa!
20925,"Oh sweetie, I found you! Now, who's gonna find us? Help!"
20926,Uh-oh.
20927,"Mmm, not bad."
20928,"Marge, please. You're embarrassing me in front of the mob."
20929,Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that.
20930,Hmm... Hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right!
20931,Start the ride!
20932,Again!
20933,Oooh.
20934,Back to the horses! Back to the horses!
20935,"Gee Lisa, looks like tomorrow I'll be shoveling ten feet of ""global warming."""
20936,"I see. So you're saying ""warming"" makes it colder. Well, aren't you the Queen of Crazyland? Everything's the opposite of everything. La-de-da-de-da! I'm Lisa Simpson. La-de-da-de-da."
20937,"Son, I love you kids. But I'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and I ain't comin' out."
20938,"Girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and I don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause I don't know."
20939,Point and shoot.
20940,Do I smell tarragon-crusted Atlantic salmon?
20941,"You had me at ""five-course,"" you lost me at ""romantic,"" and you got me back at ""dinner."""
20942,And it's not over yet.
20943,There comes a time in every marriage when it comes down to this. Do we eat dessert or do we make love?
20944,Yeah!
20945,We couldn't do both.
20946,"Hm, people in other countries make love? It's about time."
20947,"Ooo, look! ""Congress Of The Crow!"""
20948,"All right, all right, um, your ankle goes there..."
20949,And turn that upside down...
20950,...don't look at that...
20951,"More Vicodin and eggs, please."
20952,Holy moly!
20953,"Oh, sweet Meerschaum, take me away."
20954,Uh-oh.
20955,"Well, welcome, Charlie! Nice to meet ya! No glasses -- way to go! This one's a keeper!"
20956,"I know you miss him, boy. So let's you and me spend some quality father and son time."
20957,That's so fake. That's so fake. I don't know how they-- Too real!
20958,"Oh, c'mon! Look out! What would that guy-- Look out! That's funny."
20959,"Did somebody say ""naked bacon?"""
20960,"Yeah. It sounded like naked bacon to me. I don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, Tom."
20961,"No, you said ""naked bacon."""
20962,Do you guys know Funky Town?
20963,"Oh, I love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!"
20964,Now to seal you in for safety.
20965,"Hurry! If we don't get a seat in the splash zone, I've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing!"
20966,"Dad, bathing suit!"
20967,"Oops, no bathing suit."
20968,Get to the show!
20969,Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
20970,"No, I get my news off the internet."
20971,It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.
20972,Nope.
20973,How come Grampa never shares those stories with us?
20974,"Marge, my brain is like a computer, and I file away Grampa's stories in a very special place."
20975,"Hmm, while I'm up there..."
20976,Uh-oh.
20977,"Oh Dad, I got you some scotch. One of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get."
20978,"What the?! Well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been."
20979,"Stay out of this, Dad!"
20980,That's it! Here's your ring back.
20981,It's a father-son commitment band that I bought and never told you about!
20982,Drop that pillow!
20983,Stupid Grampa. I try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
20984,"Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? It's impossible. Watch."
20985,"Why you little... oh, I can't. When I look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you."
20986,I'll kill you! You son-of-a--- Don't look hurt. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
20987,"I'll show Grampa. I'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories I can share with the world."
20988,"Oh, great stuff. And the life lesson is?..."
20989,"Hmm... I'm just gonna put ""haste makes waste."""
20990,Isn't that cute? He thinks he's a pack.
20991,I have a column I'd like to submit. Pay me whenever.
20992,What? Pulitzer Prize application form?
20993,"""When I rode with Abe Simpson on the Tinseltown Starliner, I never dreamed his first voyage would be his last? At three o'clock on Monday, Abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."""
20994,How would he know Grampa was going to die today? Unless... he was going to kill him! But would someone really kill a man just to win a Pulitzer Prize?
20995,Beware of Marshall Goldmannn!
20996,A little lower... a little lower...
20997,How can you stand up to this punishment?
20998,"Dad, I don't have the right words to say how I really feel about you, but at least I know how to beat up a guy who does."
20999,Just with indifference.
21000,Really? Me? You mean it?
21001,"I've been waiting for this day for so long. The year is nineteen forty-six. In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. And that flower is an angry Japanese monster named Godzilla. How am I doin', Dad?"
21002,"Fortunately there was one man who could help: Colonel Tom Parker. The Colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name ""The Rolling Stones."" The first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. But those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen."
21003,...and that lasted about five years. But then Godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. All of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
21004,"Aw c'mon, Marge. There's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head."
21005,Not funny.
21006,"None for me, Marge. I get free donuts at work! I can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits..."
21007,"...groaning with a ""United Nations"" of donuts: jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled, the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves..."
21008,No pink box?! Wha -- what's going on?
21009,You... can't... do that...
21010,D'oh!
21011,They took away our donuts at work! All I've had are my meals!
21012,I guess these days headhunters can be anything.
21013,"You nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. Times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin'."
21014,Do you want to come in and get your sister with me?
21015,"Watch your language! Now, why the hell not?"
21016,"Oh Bart, you say that now. But when you're grown up, you'll just think it. Now you stay here and I'll get your sister."
21017,"Man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!"
21018,"Goodbye, power plant. I'd better get out of here before I have a meltdown."
21019,You can't win us back with mere donuts.
21020,That is the most amazing donut I've ever tasted.
21021,AND YOU LIKE POTATO...
21022,AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...
21023,potato!
21024,TOMATO!
21025,TOGASAKI-ROTHMAN!
21026,Songwriters who are stuck!
21027,"Don't worry, sweetie. With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride."
21028,See you at five on the dot. Phone kisses!
21029,"She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl who I married, who used to be my friend."
21030,"""Today is your lucky day."" Yeah, pfft!"
21031,"Hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--"
21032,"Hmm, maybe this is my lucky day."
21033,"A disc? Please be compact, please be compact! Woo-hoo!"
21034,Here we go.
21035,"OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN..."
21036,"I IS! OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN I IS! BOO-WEEE-BOO-WEEE-WEE-DOO-DOO-DEE-DEE-DOO-DOO"
21037,"C'mon, line, move! Maybe it'll speed up if I make ""can you believe this"" noises. Oh for goodness sake--"
21038,"...Yo no creía en fortunas, pero entonces me salió una galleta..."
21039,"...que decía que hoy era mi día dichoso. Primero no lo creí, pero entonces me caí contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!"
21040,I'm almost there... I can see the church steeple in the distance...
21041,"Uh-oh, here comes a train."
21042,"Tickets, please. Hey, where's your ticket? Leave me alone! Why you little..."
21043,No time to pretend we're friends! Lotto me!
21044,"One, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five."
21045,I did it! I'm gonna make it!
21046,"I'm a-comin', Marge!"
21047,I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it!
21048,I didn't make it?
21049,I'm alive! And surrounded by the...people I love the most in the...
21050,Could you scooch over a bit?
21051,I'll try.
21052,"Wow, I do look pretty calm down there."
21053,"Barn, thanks for picking up the money for me."
21054,"Now, what should I buy first? Hitler's baseball? A mirror that gives me advice?"
21055,Oh yeah.
21056,Marge? What are you doing?
21057,"Here I am a millionaire, and I can't even help the woman who gave birth to me."
21058,"Oh Barney, that's brilliant! Just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree."
21059,I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
21060,"Catch, boy!"
21061,Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why don't you go find it?
21062,Why you little...
21063,A box? No way!
21064,A new washing machine? No way!
21065,You go rent us a truck.
21066,"And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. I'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""
21067,Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.
21068,Why... I'm just...
21069,"Lenny... and Carl... A fortune cookie... I ran into the candy machine... and I found an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer..."
21070,"Son, if I was interested in fun, I would've run away the day you were born."
21071,You're right. I have been acting like Telethon Jerry Lewis when I should've been acting like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis. Will you teach me how to put myself first?
21072,Um... your cut of what?
21073,Here.
21074,Wait!
21075,Do you think you could use someone like me in your band?
21076,"I said someone like me, I didn't say me."
21077,"Look at me! I'm flying, like Superman's dog!"
21078,Race you to the cockpit!
21079,Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.
21080,"With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!"
21081,"Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed."
21082,"Blackmail your father in space, will you?!"
21083,"Up -- that's my chair, boy."
21084,"Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?"
21085,I agreed to no such thing!
21086,Where and what time?
21087,Never!
21088,What do I wear?
21089,Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.
21090,"Boy, this has gone too far -- I quit! As soon as I finish these oats."
21091,Not if I tell her first.
21092,"Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold..."
21093,Surprised?
21094,"Marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, I have something to confess. Um... I wasn't there for that wedding toast because... I was buying a lottery ticket."
21095,You have a right to be angry. Furious! And even though that ticket won a million dollars and--
21096,"Uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... I spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, I didn't know you could rent a balloon..."
21097,"Yes, but I have one more thing to show you."
21098,"Marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am I off the hook?"
21099,AND YOU LIKE POTATO...
21100,AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...
21101,"Carl, you're a liar, but I love it."
21102,"Uh, Mr. Burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? It's date night."
21103,"I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. We still have time to catch a movie. That can be romantic."
21104,It'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
21105,"Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie."
21106,We're outta here.
21107,How about bromance?
21108,Dude...
21109,This bromance just got interesting.
21110,Would you like to wear mittens or go commando?
21111,"What, they come here on Saturday night to clean the ice? Losers."
21112,"Marge, this is perfect for both of us! It's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!"
21113,"Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!"
21114,Curling is real.
21115,Great curling reference.
21116,There's a Winter Olympics?
21117,"Olympic trials, eh?"
21118,"Sweep! Sweep! Left, right! Left, right! Back-and-forth!"
21119,Pack your winter coat! We're going to Canada's warmest city!
21120,She used to be my therapist.
21121,How can I ever thank you?
21122,I couldn't hear the last thing you said! Goodbye forever!
21123,"OH, A PORK BAO, A SHRIMP BAO, EVERYWHERE A BAO BAO / HOMER SIMPSON WINS A GOLD / SLIDING ROCKS ON ICE... BAO BAO!"
21124,"Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?"
21125,Hm...
21126,Uh-oh.
21127,That's my Marge! High-five!
21128,It's stuck!
21129,Can I help you with that?
21130,"I'll do it myself. When we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!"
21131,"Ooo, you're hot when you're horny..."
21132,"Ooo, you're mad when you're angry..."
21133,"Marge, you're really good with your left hand."
21134,"But this time, on ice!"
21135,U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
21136,Oops.
21137,How's this for a date night?
21138,"Wonderful, Homie."
21139,"Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few..."
21140,Alcoholics.
21141,"Listen, Lisa. You're gonna find more than you bargained for. If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past. I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason."
21142,"I warn you: I don't know what's in there but if it's about a Simpson, you ain't gonna be proud."
21143,"Me neither. For once, the Simpsons were in management!"
21144,"Good point, Bart."
21145,"That's a great story, Lisa! And you should stop reading right there."
21146,"Well I don't. The motto of the Simpsons is, ""quit while you're ahead."""
21147,"Time for bed, sweetie."
21148,"You still reading that thing? I'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out. Ever!"
21149,I got an idea: you can march to Selma -- and tell her she's ugly!
21150,"The library? Bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?"
21151,Leave me alone! I have shares to crop!
21152,"Listen, Wrinkles! If you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you."
21153,About Virgil.
21154,And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!
21155,So that's why I love drinking so much.
21156,"C'est la vie, baby."
21157,"Credit card offer, overdue bill... credit card offer, overdue bill... huh, what's this?"
21158,What the... you're a month behind on homework?!
21159,A little!
21160,I say this boy needs more homework.
21161,"I don't have to do it with him, do I?"
21162,Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.
21163,"Hm. Clean dishes. I either have to unload them, or, uh..."
21164,No problem. You can unload.
21165,Oh my! A child who doesn't enjoy school? Hello? Hollywood?! You want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? A million dollars? Deal! Now I have to write it.
21166,Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!
21167,"Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair."
21168,"Too late, Marge. I already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."
21169,"Yeah, right."
21170,"Hey, why aren't you doing your homework!"
21171,You don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
21172,Well don't be wrong in front of our son!
21173,Oh yeah? Well .
21174,No line... near the men's room... I see no reason to question your choice.
21175,What the?! Then I wanna eat at Moe's Express!
21176,"That was last week, and you're still bringing it up!"
21177,Well how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
21178,"Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to!"
21179,I was too! The words were in my brain!
21180,"No freedom! I have no freedom around this house! After sex, I'm not talking to you!"
21181,"You can't sex fire me, I sex quit!"
21182,Must win fight... must win fight...
21183,Let me say to you all: I'm pretty sure this is not a dream!
21184,"Oh my God, I killed her!"
21185,"I've got to apologize. Once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage!"
21186,Must apologize. Must apologize.
21187,We can't let Bart drive us apart. He's the reason we had to get married.
21188,Bart? Bart who? I'm being cute.
21189,"Awesome breakfast, Marge! Breakfast in bed is so much better than breakfast in a chair."
21190,Whatever. Knock yourself out.
21191,"You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately. And I've realized our marriage is more important than your future. From now on, you're on your own."
21192,"Uh, Marge? I don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh..."
21193,"I love watching you knit. It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. Remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!"
21194,Yeah.
21195,"Don't know, don't care."
21196,I'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. Lisa! You're a wonderful child! Keep up the good work!
21197,Sorry!
21198,"But Marge, I thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage."
21199,Fine. I'll do both at once. We should both take a role in vacation planning!
21200,Bart!
21201,"Oh, there's a nickel."
21202,Well I'll be! There's a sofa in here!
21203,Must... squeeze... harder!
21204,Why you little...
21205,Woo hoo!
21206,And no TV!
21207,"And when you're out of my sight, you must constantly Twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though I don't know what Twitter is and have no desire to find out."
21208,"Thanks to our new G.P.S., I'll have you at school in no time."
21209,Meters?
21210,Stupid kid. Thinks he's smarter than a computer.
21211,"Seatbelts, kids!"
21212,Why you...
21213,Hey boy.
21214,Your mother thinks I'm working on the car!
21215,Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.
21216,That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
21217,I could kiss you.
21218,Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
21219,"You're halfway home, lady."
21220,"No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever."
21221,"Well, don't worry, boy. I know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls."
21222,And the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
21223,Look at that.
21224,I finally caught one of Bart's school plays.
21225,"Yeah, now that I look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody."
21226,Why you little...
21227,"Hey, my bathing suit came off!"
21228,"Hey, it floats!"
21229,Hold that thought.
21230,Here comes the butt!
21231,"Hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do I sign up?"
21232,I can't! Latkes aren't as good as American pancakes.
21233,They're okay with applesauce.
21234,A truckload of applesauce!
21235,"Flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. But the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!"
21236,After we see the stations of the omelet bar.
21237,He's going for the record! He's going for the record!
21238,"Flanders, you're not supposed to help him."
21239,"Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card."
21240,Pan-thers!
21241,If you say it like Dracula I will.
21242,"Please, please, please..."
21243,That is going right on stupidflanders.org.
21244,"This really means a lot to you, huh?"
21245,"Boy, are you lousy at reading minds."
21246,"Okay, okay. For you, I'll try."
21247,"I'm not, it's my ringtone."
21248,"Y'ello. This is he. Yeah I wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of Mount Zion? Great. I'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Yes, I know what a falafel is."
21249,"Hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. What are you up to?"
21250,Why you little...
21251,Give my Dad another heart attack?!
21252,Whuh?
21253,"I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior..."
21254,Porky Pig?
21255,"But he is buried here, right?"
21256,Chickpea Fizz.
21257,Whatever. It's your camera.
21258,Your parents made you?
21259,What? But I thought we'd be neighbors in Heaven. Goofing on all the new dead people...
21260,"Ned! Ned, wait up!"
21261,Ned!
21262,Ned's run off into the desert!
21263,Ah-ha -- a sand horse! Car of the desert!
21264,Flanders! Stupid Flanders!
21265,There's sand in my shoe!
21266,Good luck surviving without me!
21267,THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY / AND HUNGRY AND HORNY / BUT MOSTLY JUST THIR-STY / I AM SO THIR-STY...
21268,Water!
21269,So salty... Maybe if I... add a little salt...
21270,"Chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?"
21271,"Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato."
21272,"I am more than alive, woman! I am the Chosen One who shall unite all the faiths of the Holy Land! I am... the messiah!"
21273,Oh yeah. Gotta keep track of those.
21274,The messiah! Has the passports.
21275,"I'm more than okay! I am the Messiah, come to save the world! Look upon me and shudder!"
21276,"As you wish, but look not upon her with lust. And do not send her friendly emails. That's how it begins."
21277,"The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!"
21278,"This one says ""Carolina Panthers!"""
21279,Messiah says !
21280,"Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews."
21281,"Because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? They tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. But we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other."
21282,Celebrate your commonality. Some of us don't eat pork. Some of us don't eat shellfish. But all of us love chicken!
21283,Spread the word! Peace and chicken!
21284,"Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in."
21285,Can I buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?
21286,How 'bout a Greg Norman Executive Putter from the Sky Mall?
21287,They have malls on land?
21288,Woo hoo!
21289,"I say Burns owes us a party. Let's have one, right now, with his wine!"
21290,I'm pounding Melchizedeks!
21291,Woo hoo! I'm drinking my salary!
21292,"Yeah, you're right."
21293,The government. Taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.
21294,"Okay, left hand: Rembrandt!"
21295,Uh... this is my lunch.
21296,But--
21297,Eat my lunch?
21298,"Okay, I will!"
21299,You don't think I'm going to?
21300,Okay.
21301,There's always a catch.
21302,Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!
21303,Please tell me they suffered.
21304,G-g-g-g-hags!
21305,"Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you ""like your loafers light,"" I want to give something back."
21306,Use that image any way you want.
21307,Uh listen... can I leave a little early tomorrow? My kid has a thing.
21308,Smithers. What a marshmallow.
21309,I don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!
21310,"I do, but I'm not going to it."
21311,Ooh! We mock your very decency.
21312,"Well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation."
21313,"Well, at least we've got the best asbestos."
21314,"I never thought I'd say this, but I wish Mr. Burns was back."
21315,"Burns, you're coming with us."
21316,"The war is over and the future won. The past never had a chance, man!"
21317,No food allowed in bank?
21318,"Better lie low, my sweet red friend."
21319,Community service? But... that's work! What about jail?
21320,No! I wanna go to jail! Free food! Teardrop tattoos! Library books that come to youuu!
21321,I'll serve anything but the communityyy!
21322,Just my lunch.
21323,"Chicken parm, meatball parm, eggplant parm..."
21324,"Shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything."
21325,"Awwww, want a bite?"
21326,Do you ever wear your police pants to regular things?
21327,From fast food to fine dining?
21328,Oh yeah. All the time. They say it's 'cause I'm overweight.
21329,That's some big underwear.
21330,Okay. Ever been to Moe's?
21331,Oh yeah -- sorry I was such a jerk about it.
21332,"I'm there every day, five to eleven."
21333,"Oh man, this is so awesome! I can't believe I'm having breakfast where the cops do."
21334,Aw dang! I lost track of time! I'm gonna be late for work.
21335,Wow. So this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
21336,Want some sugar?
21337,Impressive.
21338,"Hey, would it be okay if I uh... ""ran a make"" on myself?"
21339,"Drunk and disorderly? That's a little redundant. Hey, uh, mind if I do a little ""spring cleaning?"""
21340,Really? Me?
21341,Chief... me too.
21342,No...
21343,"Hey, Ralph's a good kid. And he should be, he's got a great Dad."
21344,"Ooh, ooh! Can I cuff him?!"
21345,Is he gonna be okay?
21346,"Don't worry, Sarah. Clancy was there for me. And I'll be there for him."
21347,Oops.
21348,"Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer."
21349,"Don't die on me, Clancy. You said our friendship was special. Well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of..."
21350,You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
21351,"Clancy, I haven't seen my family in days. Would you mind if I went home now?"
21352,"Well, if you really want me to stay..."
21353,Fine! I'll stay a little more.
21354,Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.
21355,"Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."""
21356,"Hey man, you planted that!"
21357,"Oh, everything reminds me of Clancy."
21358,Everything.
21359,I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work.
21360,"Hey, Chief. I uh, brought a thirty-two piece chicken bucket."
21361,"Well, I was kind of ungrateful. You did save my life."
21362,"We're not gonna get whacked. Because you're Chief Clancy Wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this."
21363,"No, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. Your awesomeness is real."
21364,I know just the guy.
21365,Flanders! Wake up! Take off your clothes and prepare to be raptured.
21366,"Now, shave off your moustache and drink the hairs in a cup of cocoa."
21367,"No, ice cold."
21368,Look at this electric bill! I'm not made of money! I'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
21369,"It's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. Lamp, computer, Jacob's Ladder..."
21370,How long has this been running?
21371,Are you calling me fat?
21372,"Hmm... Alternative Energy Expo. Where there's expos, there's free Frisbees! Let's roll. But we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out."
21373,"Now, on to the next funny booth."
21374,"Yeah, so is getting a real job."
21375,A churro you can eat in the shower?
21376,"Well, I'm not usually one to take the word of a Dane... plus, how can I afford it?"
21377,Months?
21378,"Hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal."
21379,I'm starting to regret it already.
21380,"Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good. Where's my Grammy for audio book narration?"
21381,Oh my goodness! It means we're traveling back in time! I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!
21382,"Oh, that's just great. I discover electricity and they want to take it from me!"
21383,"Hello, local utility? You greedy bastards have gouged Homer Simpson for the last time."
21384,The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!
21385,"Gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. The kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!"
21386,"Don't worry, I'll go see what's wrong!"
21387,What the? Who turned off the wind?
21388,"Oh. Well I'm not crawling back to big electricity! From now on, the Simpsons are living intermittently."
21389,"The wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. Check it out, gang."
21390,But we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!
21391,You used to be nicer!
21392,Now we're cookin' with wind!
21393,Nothing is ever right for you.
21394,"Be careful! If you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation."
21395,We'll have to eat Thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
21396,All right -- let me get my tool belt.
21397,"Man, who are these belts made for, French supermodels?"
21398,"Sure. Lisa, bring the car around."
21399,Haven't you learned anything from watching Bart drive?
21400,"Marge, how hard can it be? We're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. It's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a Mexican prison."
21401,"Ooh, it's dinner time!"
21402,But that would make a great movie.
21403,"That whale's not gonna die! We're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, Escobar! God, this thing writes itself."
21404,Coming!
21405,"Okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water."
21406,Hm. We need a better idea. We'll have to find the town's smartest men.
21407,"One, two, three, tug!"
21408,It was my idea to put the whale in the water.
21409,"Don't worry, honey. Right now she's lying on God's beach."
21410,"Oh Lisa, I'm sorry. I tried my best. I know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect."
21411,"I'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! Lisa, where were we?"
21412,Of course.
21413,It kills me to see her like that. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's being killed.
21414,"Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I got you a pet that will never die. An invisible dog."
21415,"Aw, look. He's doing his business."
21416,"Hey! Not on the rug! You bad dog! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop biting my leg! Ow! Alright, that's it! You're going outside!"
21417,Bad dog! Stop!
21418,Why couldn't I be eaten by a giraffe? That would be fun!
21419,Nature is a toothless dying hag! We are gonna save those whale babies!
21420,I'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! Get in!
21421,Shark week just got cancelled.
21422,Oh come on! Leave me alone! I'm trying to save your precious whales!
21423,You like sharks?
21424,Typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!
21425,"Sharks, innocent? Please. Every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. The shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder..."
21426,"Ooh, a baby whale. My diet is working."
21427,"Ooh, maybe the blood will scare the sharks off!"
21428,"Thanks, buddy!"
21429,"Hey, I'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which I mean you."
21430,"Absolutely. He's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. They'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. But if I'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way."
21431,I want some of that!
21432,Guess what company had a giveaway at Moe's last night?
21433,Keep guessing...
21434,"What's it say, boy?"
21435,Mmmm. Good mac and cheese.
21436,I'll have to check it out sometime.
21437,Mmm.
21438,I am pretty full.
21439,I'm on my way!
21440,Golf ball-sized hail!
21441,Woo-hoo!
21442,/
21443,All right! All right!
21444,I'm goin' home. It's not safe in here.
21445,"Hey boy, whatcha doing?"
21446,My little Einstein.
21447,"A phony bird call?! That means Marge is coming! Everyone, act legal!"
21448,"Well, uh... The one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so I'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?"
21449,"Remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? Well, now I can afford a motorcycle!"
21450,Who wants feet steak?
21451,"Oh no! I don't have to listen to you. If I'm not on camera, you can't see me!"
21452,"Everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder. ""Don't leave your sprinklers on in the rain!"" ""Don't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies!"""
21453,Later. Later.
21454,"You see, Ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil."
21455,"God created the devil? Finally, He did something cool."
21456,"Well, if you ask me, you were trying to play God."
21457,You can help me take out those cameras.
21458,Moe's leaving town?!
21459,"I like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach."
21460,Cleaning the gutters?
21461,Cartoons! Everybody be quiet!
21462,"So, Marge, what were we talking about?"
21463,"Sorry, honey. I wasn't listening. And I won't be listening now."
21464,"Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything."
21465,"I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing."
21466,"Into the playpen, sweetie. And if you get hungry, there's lobster!"
21467,It's from Moe!
21468,Moe is running off with one of our wives?!
21469,I got Marge!
21470,Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!
21471,You're losing me? Or you're leaving me?!
21472,Aw dammit!
21473,Can't talk! Must text!
21474,"Marge, have u left me 4..."
21475,"Well, Marge and I don't have any problems. We never even fight anymore."
21476,What?
21477,"Moe, my in-laws are coming. I need something strong enough that I forget I hate them, but not so strong that I tell them I love them."
21478,"Marge, this is crazy!"
21479,Flanders?!
21480,All right.
21481,What the--
21482,Why you--
21483,Lousy--
21484,You take that back!
21485,"Go ugly up someone else's house, you penis-curling she-devils!"
21486,I'm doomed.
21487,Uh... I do.
21488,"I was there when your wife got to Moe's, being my usual effervescent self..."
21489,I don't know.
21490,"Yeah, Padre. How innocuous are your flashbacks?"
21491,The ferry will be back in ten minutes. It'll take us home... to find out the truth.
21492,"Today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous."
21493,"Otto, you got to get us back to town!"
21494,She's packing her bag!
21495,Thirty-nine.
21496,Marge! No! Stop packing your--
21497,Painting supplies?!
21498,You're not leaving me?
21499,"Oh Marge, you not leaving with Moe is the best thing that never happened to me."
21500,"Moe, I don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so I'm gonna do both."
21501,Why should I? The city's broke! They can't afford to enforce their precious laws!
21502,Cookies... so delicious... must buy house.
21503,Marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!
21504,...initial the radon disclosure... and done.
21505,"But my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!"
21506,"Man, you're good with the tools when you want to be."
21507,"Or Frasier on ""Frasier."""
21508,"Stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette."
21509,Ice cream!
21510,Nothing is ever boobs or ice cream.
21511,"Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again."
21512,"All right, Sideshow. I'm gonna do to you what you shoulda done to my son a long time ago!"
21513,It's like you're a Chinese empress!
21514,And I'm not a locksmith!
21515,"Man, that dude does not like Bart."
21516,Mexico! Andalé! Andalé! Arriba!
21517,"Help us! Help us, for the love of God! Won't somebody help us?!"
21518,"Uh yes, I'd like... um... how do you say taco in Mexican?"
21519,"Yes, that's exactly the word I want to translate."
21520,"Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it."
21521,Stop! Stop! Stop!
21522,That is disgusting.
21523,Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.
21524,Oh my God.
21525,"You never fail to nauseate me, boy."
21526,"I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you."
21527,"Half an hour to show time, your ugliness."
21528,"But if we win this, we get a gift certificate."
21529,It doesn't matter.
21530,You can't close! I'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!
21531,"Oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--"
21532,Yeah. Now what am I supposed to do?
21533,Okay.
21534,"Well, since Moe's is closed again, I thought I'd help you cook dinner."
21535,What are we watching?
21536,After the title page it's Bob Dole's memoirs.
21537,"Now that I have all this free time, I thought I would do you a huge favor."
21538,I organized the kitchen. I labeled everything with a label maker...
21539,And I also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!
21540,Uh-oh. What kind of ventilating is that?
21541,"Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar."
21542,Watchin' hockey! Watchin' 'em pass that puck! Oh yeah!
21543,"Uh, the Long Island Ice Teas?"
21544,"Well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. So, I decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny I left in my pants went."
21545,"Ah, those guys are all crooks. They charge you for parts and labor? Pick one, buddy! I can do this just fine by myself."
21546,"Don't worry, I got it!"
21547,Marge! You ruined my shot!
21548,That was awesome. I feel like the Tiger Woods of sex.
21549,It's four AM -- you kids should've been in bed a half hour ago!
21550,"Oooh, the Nobies!"
21551,Lucky.
21552,I would kill for that.
21553,Arctic Circle! I just got that!
21554,How easy am I?
21555,Can my son come too? He knows what to do when I swallow my tongue.
21556,They fight and bite? I never go to Europe without learning something.
21557,Another good one...
21558,Did you say a Hague?
21559,Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty.
21560,"Uh, what region is America?"
21561,Woo hoo! We're Region One! We're Region One!
21562,No fair! We just went to church!
21563,Fifty bucks each?! That's your life savings?!
21564,HIS STRIKE ZONE'S THE SIZE / OF A TUNA FISH CAN...
21565,"Five hundred dollars? That's, like, ten dead Grampas! Some of us stuck to our limit, Marge. And I would've loved to rent this carpet cleaner another day!"
21566,"Well, it's a cat -- I'm not sure it's the cat."
21567,"You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town."
21568,"After Bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made."
21569,"Come on, Marge -- let's hit the buffet."
21570,"Oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- Wiggum's making his move!"
21571,"Sure, sure!"
21572,Let me just grab one more shrimp.
21573,I believe this stranger!
21574,Check and mate.
21575,"Wait a minute, Marge. Don't you realize what just happened?"
21576,"You got to enjoy that bag for nothing! We can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund."
21577,"Hide a sandwich in this hat. ""Mary Poppins"" myself to work with this umbrella."
21578,"Yeah, the luck lasts longer! Thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!"
21579,Come in. Come in. Don't wipe your feet.
21580,I wish. What the hell are you doing?!
21581,"Now, everyone onto the hot tub."
21582,"Come on on, the cardboard's fine."
21583,"Good afternoon. I'd like to return this merchandise. Wrong size, wrong color, not as pictured, and other reason please explain."
21584,Yes... uh... maybe I'll just come back during someone else's shift... Is Claire working today? She's a real sucker.
21585,How do you know my name?
21586,"It's not what you think... I came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um..."
21587,Yes! I mean no! I mean... You'll never get me!
21588,"I have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?"
21589,"Initial there, and... Never!"
21590,Can you tell me when this is gonna be on? I'm thinking of having a party.
21591,"Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?"
21592,"Sorry, Marge. The last time I stepped on a baseball field, I got tased."
21593,"That's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy."
21594,"Hey pal, howya doin'?"
21595,"Hey, let's hold hands and skip inside!"
21596,Woo hoo! Underpants dinner!
21597,I'll put a stop to this nonsense!
21598,"Sorry Marge, I gotta call bullcrap on that. The '69 Mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's wife and kids? Not me -- and, I assume, not Ron Swoboda!"
21599,"Boys don't have feelings, they have muscles."
21600,"They sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally."
21601,...Then Pete Rose plowed into his friend Ray Fosse...
21602,...dislocating Fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game...
21603,"...He had earned the nickname ""Charlie Hustle..."""
21604,"If he makes it, that's my son!"
21605,You stink!
21606,"Oh man, I'm never comin' down."
21607,Woo hoo! Another ladder!
21608,"Ridin' high! Sinkin' low! Top of the heap! Down I go! On top for good! Oh, cruel hubris!"
21609,"Man, it's been a crazy morning. Champagne?"
21610,"Yeah, charts are for squares, baby."
21611,That's my cell phone.
21612,"What is it? Lenny, I'm on a second honeymoon. You'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. Now, where were we?"
21613,Oh baby. Let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.
21614,"Oh yeah baby, I like it when you're distracted."
21615,"Fine, I'll get the hook."
21616,"Don't fight it... That's it... That's it, a little more... How's that?"
21617,"You're safe now, my friend."
21618,"O-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know..."
21619,Fine. I'm going for a walk.
21620,"Hey, I've had a hard trip too. One of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses."
21621,"Marge, can I have a word with you in private?"
21622,I don't trust that guy. I bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.
21623,Why do pie makers get all the girls?
21624,It was poisoned.
21625,"Well, it was rhubarb."
21626,Berry-peach?! That's my favorite!
21627,"Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!"
21628,"They should call this one ""recipe for murder."""
21629,Never mind.
21630,"Ooh, got a text."
21631,"Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea."
21632,Come 'n' get it barnacles!
21633,This proves nothing. Roger could've been the one that killed them!
21634,Then... his story was true!
21635,"Hey pal, how ya been?"
21636,The pie you baked us killed that shark!
21637,"We had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him."
21638,Looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death.
21639,"Oh, come on! Just a second..."
21640,Bankers away!
21641,I repeat: no one will ever know.
21642,"Marge, what are you doing? That pie is poisoned!"
21643,She just wanted to ride bikes through New England. But those seats hurt my ass!
21644,Ever wonder what she thinks about?
21645,"I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow."
21646,I get the drumstick!
21647,"Okay, okay. If a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?"
21648,"Okay, okay. If you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?"
21649,"Man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day..."
21650,"Boy, this place has every kind of vampire there is."
21651,Excuse me?
21652,Have you seen these kids?
21653,Super-Team -- fly!
21654,Hyah! Hyah!
21655,"Back off, you unholy dreamboat!"
21656,Pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.
21657,"Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?"
21658,"Well, nobody loves his kids more than me!"
21659,Come and get it.
21660,And not the good kind!
21661,Woo-hoo!
21662,Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!
21663,Nooooo!
21664,"Maggie, you can't climb into the TV. If you could, I'd make Alex Trebek answer some questions."
21665,"No child of mine will go without anything, ever! Except quality healthcare!"
21666,"Nice part of town you got here. Too bad you keep it so far away. Now that we're best friends, can I get the baby elf?"
21667,You can't tell what's inside! Of all the times not to have x-ray vision.
21668,I'll take... that one.
21669,"Aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!"
21670,You're lucky you're behind glass.
21671,"Sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!"
21672,Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
21673,Woo hoo!
21674,"Oh I'm sorry, Maggie, but even at your age, I'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... I can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!"
21675,The march of progress.
21676,Be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
21677,Just don't dress me up like a woman.
21678,"Tell her ""no deal""."
21679,"What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son?"
21680,"Hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. Sooner or later, everyone meets their ""Homer."""
21681,"It may not be a boy. It could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the Santa Fe lifestyle. Just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die."
21682,"Oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. G'night."
21683,"No, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. Goodnight!"
21684,"Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain."
21685,She does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!
21686,"Well, if you check your purse I think you'll find... the seven of clubs!"
21687,"I am so sorry, Marge."
21688,Ta-da!
21689,That would be one weird-looking kid.
21690,"Oh, I've seen that look before. That's the ""I ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years"" look."
21691,Run!
21692,"Thank you, four-eyes!"
21693,What time Monday?
21694,Thank you.
21695,All right!
21696,"Your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. So, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you sweet dreams."
21697,Look what Maggie got!
21698,"Up, a father has his secrets."
21699,"Hurry up, boy. We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid."
21700,All right. We'll get the vaccine.
21701,I thought he was an old clump of rags.
21702,Why did Burns make us all come here?
21703,Hell yeah!
21704,Or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!
21705,"Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with."
21706,"Marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you."
21707,"Now boy, everyone in town gets Burns for half an hour to do as they will."
21708,Amen.
21709,"Okay, Burnsie, follow the carrot!"
21710,"Don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end."
21711,Where's the other girder?
21712,Already?
21713,"Yeah, I've done all I can do in that medium."
21714,You're welcome!
21715,"And so The Bloody Hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey."
21716,"KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / I'M AFTER YOU / WITH MY BLOODY NOOSE / STRONG ENOUGH TO HANG TEN MOOSE / KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / IT'S JUST A STORY, BUT IT'S REALLY TRUE!"
21717,"No, I'm no-ot! Yes I am. The Bloody Hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London..."
21718,"Did I? Anyway, the Bloody Hangman set to his gory work. Bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs."
21719,Possibly!
21720,The Hangman's here!
21721,"Ker-shaw, ker-shew, my lies have come true!"
21722,"All finished, boy."
21723,Flimsy? This gentle pat says different.
21724,"Is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken I played, lost to, and ate at the State Fair?"
21725,Way ahead of you.
21726,You can race pigeons?
21727,"Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty..."
21728,Danica Patrick in my thoughts!
21729,Ended that a little too soon.
21730,What they don't suspect is that I'm into this.
21731,Stupid dog! Let go of that delicious bird!
21732,"Come on out, birdie! Follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice."
21733,"Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: ""Hope is the thing with feathers..."""
21734,Stupid dog!
21735,"Marge, listen to the man -- he pays Bart's salary."
21736,Why can't you support my gibberish? I'd do it if you were stupid!
21737,A shrink who takes kids and pets?
21738,Even my tramp stamp?
21739,I got the idea from a show where people regret these.
21740,Oh baby! Well whaddaya know! Oh come on!
21741,"Nicely done, boy."
21742,"Oh, that's pretty sure. Subscription rate, right?"
21743,"Hmm... Back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, Flanders' mailbox, Lenny's freezer, tire fire."
21744,Enough chitchat. Time for operation dog dump.
21745,It was still too much.
21746,"I'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches."
21747,Maybe we should get going.
21748,"Marge, I'm watching a rerun of an important Bowl game."
21749,I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
21750,"Ooo, unknown caller!"
21751,Hey!
21752,"All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt."
21753,You said nobody gets hurt. Those were your exact words!
21754,"Well, Bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner."
21755,Maggie.
21756,"Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that."
21757,"I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go."
21758,You're gonna be okay.
21759,It's almost over.
21760,Now to take care of the witnesses.
21761,I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
21762,"Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? Well, instead I grew this tree!"
21763,You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy! Next you won't want a Christmas ham.
21764,"Sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could."
21765,"Marge is Mia? Oh my God, she changed her name?"
21766,Why couldn't it have been me?
21767,Shut up.
21768,Whose turn is it to cry?
21769,Look at that picture!
21770,"Someday TV will be invented, and it will be free. Then it will cost money."
21771,"Now remember, pack only necessities."
21772,Now we just have to make it.
21773,YOU'LL BE OH SO PLEASED / WHEN THE O.J. IS FRESHLY-SQUEEZED / AND TOAST IS MADE FROM HOMEMADE
21774,WE'RE GONNA GO OUT FOR BREAKFAST / WE'LL GO OUT TO EAT / IT'LL BE ANY PLACE YOU CHOOSE / AS LONG AS IT'S RUN BY JEWS / 'CAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THIS HOLIDAY'S SO GREAT.
21775,"ALOHA'OE / ALOHA'OE... Hurry up, kids! We gotta get to the airport!"
21776,Now nothing stands between us and sunny Hawa...
21777,Ai-yi-yi-yi!
21778,I got the week off by telling Mr. Burns I had a neck injury!
21779,"Mr. Burns, why'd you come to see me?"
21780,Uh... uh...
21781,Coming!
21782,"Fine, I'll come clean."
21783,"No, it's not. I just told a lie so we could go to Hawaii."
21784,Sh!
21785,"C'mon, jus' one more drink, Marge."
21786,"Sweetie, relax. Let's just watch some TV."
21787,Huh? What'd I do?
21788,Fifty bucks?! That used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!
21789,What the hell?!
21790,"C'mon, Lou. Gimme a break!"
21791,Since when is all this against the law?
21792,This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it's ruined.
21793,"Oh, I get it. The government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy."
21794,That's almost a thousand dollars!
21795,Ten minutes? I can't wait that long! I left an ice cream cone in my cup holder!
21796,"Chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. I meant to write ""bride."" It's a wedding present."
21797,My bribe!
21798,"It's okay, it's okay. I can be out in eighteen months with good behavior."
21799,Don't tell me I'm not capable of good behavior!
21800,"Your honor, I would like to request a sidebar."
21801,"All that time I'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise..."
21802,I repeat: unable to exercise...
21803,What? This guy?
21804,I can't go undercover with Fat Tony. He's met me. I've been in his house. I was briefly his Consiglieri... Consugly... Canolli... Robert Duvall.
21805,Can I be Johnny Undercover?
21806,"Okay, Melvin Mafia."
21807,Can I keep the name after I'm done?
21808,Ayyyy! Ohhhh! Ayyyy! Ohhhh!
21809,Fuhgetaboutit!
21810,"Uh, what's my name again?"
21811,"Okay, I'm comin'."
21812,"I'd like a third helping, please."
21813,Just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are!
21814,"Hey, you're that guy from the F.B.--"
21815,There was barbecue sauce on it.
21816,But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.
21817,What's a dime store?
21818,Blue pants power!
21819,Beating? What beating?
21820,Oh. That beating.
21821,Can I have any of the steaks?
21822,That's so mean!
21823,Please! Let me have it! Come on! Give it to me right in the mouth!
21824,Well... back in my keister you go.
21825,How're you gonna do that?
21826,I'll take care of this.
21827,"Oregano, basil, rosemary..."
21828,"Sorry, boss."
21829,Yeah. Those guys are probably FBI informants.
21830,Oh yeah. I got in your gang and you barely know who I am.
21831,What are we doing here?
21832,"Well, I guess I could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette."
21833,Oh no! No! I... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.
21834,This is horrible! I keep smelling my own breath!
21835,My neck is kind of itchy.
21836,Huh?
21837,"Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!"
21838,Don't ask questions! Just go!
21839,Ayyyy!
21840,Ayyyy!
21841,Ohhhh!
21842,Ayyyy.
21843,Ohhhh.
21844,No! You're wrong! Check again!
21845,"So that's it! You used me to kill a man, and all I get is a handshake and a blanket?"
21846,Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.
21847,"It's not over, Marge. It'll never be over. When I shut my eyes, all I see is Fat Tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach."
21848,"Oh. Well, uh... you wouldn't like it. It's not very good."
21849,"No, no, I oversold it."
21850,I'd give anything to bring you back.
21851,Fat Tony?
21852,"Wow, I've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising."
21853,I understand. I loved him too.
21854,"Do what you gotta do. The quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there."
21855,I worked for Fat Tony. And he was the best boss I ever had.
21856,"Wha-- oh, oh, uh, Mr. Burns? Uh, you were cool too."
21857,He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. Then he said he would dope a horse for me.
21858,Are you gonna kill me now? 'Cause I'm super ready.
21859,"Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?"
21860,And your enemies closer?
21861,Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.
21862,"The pressures got to him so he started to eat. Soon, he was known as ""Fit Fat Tony,"" then just ""Fat Tony"" for short."
21863,"And me? Now, I'm just an average shnook like everyone else."
21864,Stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. And the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.
21865,"And I have to admit, it's a pretty good life."
21866,Can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
21867,Are you through with the chair? I've got to do the taxes.
21868,"Okay let's see, number of dependents: three. Um, add to line thirteen..."
21869,"Hm, better check last year's return."
21870,Hm.
21871,"Been a while since our wives got together, huh?"
21872,"Ooh, I got a text!"
21873,Are you gonna open it?
21874,Because you're my best friend in the room.
21875,Anyone see a good beer commercial lately?
21876,"Sure, I'll stay home and Skype with the guys at Moe's."
21877,Stupid Flanders' wi-fi!
21878,"Ion. Hmm... No. ""Irene Ryan is TV's Granny."""
21879,This is late for Marge. I assume. I've never been home at this hour.
21880,"Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?"
21881,Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.
21882,"It's kind of weird, us all being naked in here."
21883,Right... neither am I.
21884,"Ooh, three!"
21885,"Well, I've put it off, but today I'm finally getting this garage organized--"
21886,Guess I'll put these tools away. Put 'em on hooks and stuff.
21887,Can we at least drink beer or something?
21888,"Oh, you beautiful man."
21889,God you're hilarious.
21890,I don't like those guys.
21891,Oh no. I left a candy bar in my desk.
21892,Time to punch in.
21893,A dinosaur!
21894,Huh?
21895,He's washing his hands.
21896,Wait a minute! Your standard markup is four hundred percent?
21897,"Check out my tolerance, Marge. I'm going to use the men's room."
21898,"Hey, I didn't know you were... uh... you know, one of those--"
21899,But you do like comic books.
21900,Ah! Got one!
21901,Everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.
21902,"Lisa, mash the buttons till something good comes on."
21903,Life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
21904,"I liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. But the supervising producing was the best I've ever seen."
21905,"Bart, son, if I bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it."
21906,"Because when you get anything you want, you don't want anything you get."
21907,Someday you'll understand that I'm just being a good dad.
21908,Why you little!!!
21909,Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.
21910,"Son, I won't strangle you anymore, but I also won't get you that mini-bike."
21911,"Wish I could, son. I really wish I could."
21912,Bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but I didn't think it was the right thing to do.
21913,"Marge, not in front of the refrigerator."
21914,"Well in that case, Lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so I opened the drapes to let in more sun."
21915,"Well, in season two, when Sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward."
21916,"And if you do it, son, you'll get the same."
21917,That's great.
21918,"Son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work."
21919,"Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends."
21920,"Hmm, if this were a TV show that would be a helluva act break."
21921,"But it could use a button. Oh, what if I said... Well if you..."
21922,You still see that crow on shows sometimes.
21923,"Hey, Apu."
21924,Can't lose that. It's the best picture of me I have.
21925,"Yeah, I do know a lot about nuclears."
21926,"Marge, would you like a ""Thicker Than Waters"" collectible plate?"
21927,Oh yeah? I'll show you.
21928,"""TV Guide Offer, One World Trade Center..."""
21929,Awww...
21930,"And I love having you here, son. 'Cause you can wake me up if somebody comes."
21931,"Check this out, Bart. One of those retinal scan dealies. It only opens to my eye or an exact copy."
21932,Let's see if this works.
21933,"Damn, that hurt!"
21934,I'll just use my eye.
21935,Because you've been such a great kid lately and I wanted to show you I appreciated it.
21936,"Hmm, the boy's acting really weird. I did everything that TV show told me to and he's still not happy."
21937,Where is he going?
21938,Why on earth would a child go to the zoo...?
21939,Step away from the traitor!
21940,The boy's flash drive may be in there. But I've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.
21941,I know what you're saying! I understand food talk in every language!
21942,Um... I'll see myself out.
21943,"Okay, who can take me to the airport for less than twenty dollars? I can stand here all day."
21944,My feet hurt.
21945,"Well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the TV."
21946,"CHERISH THAT FAMILY SMILE / PICKET FENCE DAYS GO SOMETHING SOMETHING / THE FUTURE IS COMING SOON / MOM AND DAD AND KIDS ARE SOMMMMETHING That's my favorite song now. Sorry ""Don't Fear the Reaper."" Everybody! Air guitar! Come on, do it with me! Use your whammy bar! Whew! Now fuzz it up! Excellent!"
21947,"Now all you need are customers. Well, better get home to the little woman."
21948,Do you have plans for tonight?
21949,"Oh, thank you, prior obligation!"
21950,Drive my kids to school?! Never!
21951,Stupid double snuggler's hitch! Only hope is to chew off my leg.
21952,"Ow! Ow! Huh, mmm, not bad. Just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours."
21953,"Oh Marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties."
21954,"Well, it's not easy with you talking all the time."
21955,So... chicken.
21956,"Sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. Let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims."
21957,What has she done?! I feel like I'm married to Richard Gere!
21958,"I can't talk now, I'm talking to myself! No, no, Homer, go ahead. Thanks, Homer, it'll just be a minute. What's up?"
21959,"So basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. Like West Virginia does for Virginia."
21960,The good doctor has just the prescription.
21961,You ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately?
21962,"Yes, that's exactly it!"
21963,Oh I know.
21964,"So Lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?"
21965,"Well, I don't know... it's a lot of work."
21966,Deal!
21967,I do keep it together.
21968,Uh-oh. Usually when it gets this quiet Mr. Burns is standing behind me.
21969,Marge? What are you doing here? This bar is for singles and wingmen only.
21970,"Marge, Marge, put down that broom. You've got nothing to be afraid of from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition including Val Kilmer from ""Top Gun,"" Wedge Antilles from ""Star Wars,"" and me, from now. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing I get to go home to you."
21971,And you know what else this whole experience has taught me?
21972,Probably.
21973,"Well, I guess I do have a ""type."""
21974,"Is my job creating power, empowering?"
21975,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
21976,He's dying in a retirement home. Now kiss me.
21977,Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in!
21978,Okay... I'll take some of... that.
21979,Mix it in.
21980,"That's it, boy! I'm eating your yogurt!"
21981,He didn't know that!
21982,Stupid kid. All you do is cost me money. Money I could be wasting!
21983,"Wealthy? Hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. Eh?"
21984,"So, what brings you here, Mr. Chair?"
21985,"I legally forced him to say ""semi""."
21986,My little Roman Polanski!
21987,What?! What's wrong with being Roman Polanski?
21988,He what?...
21989,You monster!
21990,Observe.
21991,Soda?
21992,More for me.
21993,It would be an honor!
21994,"There's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your ""table read."""
21995,"""Family, today I graduate from my anger management class."""
21996,Pained noises.
21997,"Oh okay, uh, Lenny, hit me with that chair."
21998,"Don't feel bad, boy. Everyone makes mistakes. Yours is just public and expensive."
21999,Woo hoo!
22000,I have many people to thank...
22001,"Angry Dad's voice is part Walter Matthau... Hey, Felix!... part Little Richard Whoooo! ...and a little bit of Snoopy when he cries."
22002,I'd like to thank Mr. Speedy Pants Repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the Bangles. See you at the cool party!
22003,Hey! Don't you know it's awards season? Who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
22004,"If I find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble."
22005,Uh-oh.
22006,Oscars? What are you talking about? My son gave me this list of awesome things to do in L.A.
22007,Hmm... Who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?
22008,"I was born a Rollin' Eighty, and I'll die a Rollin' Eighty."
22009,"You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit."
22010,"Hey, they're like five bucks on eBay."
22011,"Oh, hi! Ricky Gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, Sir Ridley. I love your movies. Or as I call them, ""films."" Umm, glad I bumped into you, actually. Because, uh, I'm looking to expand beyond comedy. I know what you're thinking, Sir Ridley. You're thinking ""Oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. I'm gonna have to put him in my new film. What do you think?"
22012,I'm a seat filler.
22013,Well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? Don't take any of my ideas.
22014,"Me! Me! I want him every night, and forever and ever! 'Cause I love my--"
22015,"That's great, honey. If you were a boy, you'd be a scientist."
22016,"Hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!"
22017,It does!
22018,And there's something else it might be good for.
22019,Why are you guys eating so fast?
22020,"Uh, you look tense. Let's discuss this over a cup of Grampa's coffee."
22021,Your kisses feel like raw liver.
22022,"Come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! I wanna take Grampa to have his bellybutton pierced."
22023,"Oh, because Lisa won't tell me what flower it's from."
22024,Yeah. But Lisa won't tell me how to make it.
22025,Nerd.
22026,Huh? This one didn't make me feel anything.
22027,"Thank you for the tour of your factory, Mister Wonka."
22028,Go ahead.
22029,That's what I was gonna call it!
22030,"Oh yeah -- we better ""grump it up."""
22031,Your grandfather is not a monster.
22032,"Now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town."
22033,It better be tonsillitis.
22034,"So, I guess we're all in the same boat, huh?"
22035,"Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!"
22036,Flat tire? No problem!
22037,"Great idea, but I don't have any money."
22038,And I wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! What are the odds of that much time happening?
22039,Problem solved. Generation awesome does it again!
22040,"Their ""can-do"" will bail out our ""won't-try"" every time!"
22041,Cheech and Chong are coming back to Springfield?
22042,"Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!"
22043,I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room!
22044,He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
22045,Back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. Which was about three times.
22046,Hide the dope!
22047,Then what did I just smoke?
22048,I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
22049,"Ooo, he's gonna say ""Dave's not here!"""
22050,Dave's not here! Dave's not here!
22051,Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
22052,I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals.
22053,"Dave's not here, man!"
22054,Dave?
22055,"Dave's not here, man!"
22056,I'll give Dave your message.
22057,My time being wasted was not wasted!
22058,Yes! Will I get to meet Dave?
22059,How 'bout Don Johnson?
22060,It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech.
22061,"Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry..."
22062,I can't believe I'm riding around in Cheech's van! The van made of weed!
22063,Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? Lysergic acid diethylamide?
22064,"Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong."
22065,Can we get high from the fumes?
22066,CHEECH AND CHONG HAS LOST ITS CHONG / I AM THE CHONG NOW... TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT ME-E...
22067,"Oh yeah, I getcha -- ""work on the show."" Maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? Marijuana reference!"
22068,Hard work? I thought this was gonna be fun.
22069,CHEECH IS SURE A LOT LESS COOL / THAN I IMAGINED...
22070,BETTER SHUT UP / CHEECH IS REALLY MAD / I WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH CHO-ONG...
22071,"Oh yeah, a reward from Cheech!"
22072,Hmm?
22073,What the?!
22074,Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
22075,Eurocentric! When do we have wacky adventures?
22076,Can we at least get some French fries?
22077,Stop speaking Spanish!
22078,It's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from Cheech and Chunk.
22079,"Yes, sir."
22080,Tour bus parked. Gotta save Marge!
22081,"Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too."
22082,"Don't look back, Marge. Don't look back."
22083,Let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. We've got something more important to attend to.
22084,We'll deal with all that later.
22085,"C'mon, if Art Garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp Paul Simon, you can do this."
22086,Tell him how you feel.
22087,"Come on, surrender to the moment! Don't make the mistake I always do of thinking too much before you act!"
22088,"Hold on, lemme get the door here."
22089,Who are you?
22090,"Oh, okay, wait, let's start again."
22091,"I'll be out here with you, Dave."
22092,Yes?
22093,Okay. I'll go get some stuff.
22094,Way down here?
22095,Okay!
22096,All right!
22097,"Gee, sorry, Dave."
22098,Hey! Mr. Burns needs our help!
22099,"Looks like it's up to me. Let's see, target at two o'clock... adjust for wind ..."
22100,But I haven't finished my rituals yet!
22101,All your money and all your stuff.
22102,"Uh, Super Bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?"
22103,"Well, this has been great. We should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting."
22104,"Oh, that's right! I hope you kids are enjoying yourselves today, because you and your children will be paying for this place long after the team moves to another city."
22105,"EVERYBODY DANCE NOW! DO, DO, DO, DO / DO, DO, DO, DO..."
22106,"Come on, party pooper -- bust a move!"
22107,"Aw, come on, sourpuss. Tickle tickle!"
22108,Tickle tickle too!
22109,Tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!
22110,"Marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. Has the Joker taught you nothing?"
22111,"Son, I'm really, really sorry."
22112,"Oh, I don't know if I can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. I-- whoo!... but I sincerely whoo!"
22113,No one else is doing it. I'm trying to start it. Whoo!
22114,Whoo!
22115,Bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
22116,"Well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!"
22117,Now I have to work overtime--
22118,--just to counteract the self-confidence--
22119,"Well of course, I would love to be a more sensitive father. You know that."
22120,I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
22121,"Please, Marge, no! The other negligent dads'll make fun of me! They're so cliquey!"
22122,I miss my friends from drunk driving school. They were so cool.
22123,"Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. But, oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt. So anyway, I'm strangling him, and I said to Bart..."
22124,"Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! Right? Anyway, I said ""Bart""..."
22125,I guess it's just how I was raised.
22126,"So... are those butter cookies for everybody, or..."
22127,Who do you have next period?
22128,"Hey, Doc. Where is everybody?"
22129,Why didn't you tell me not to come?
22130,Wha-wha-what are you doing?
22131,"No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!"
22132,"Dr. Zander, you made me see my life through Bart's neck, and I swear, I will never, ever strangle my boy again."
22133,"Um, I uh, lied about having health insurance."
22134,"Hello, boy."
22135,I want you to know I'm cured.
22136,"Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man."
22137,Now it feels like morning. What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
22138,Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
22139,"Oh come on, bust your daddy's chops."
22140,Why you little...?!
22141,I'll teach you to...
22142,Why you... I'm gonna... Maybe this time...
22143,Can't hurt the boy. Can't hurt the boy.
22144,What the?!
22145,"Boy, get down from there!"
22146,All right.
22147,Why you little...
22148,"Oh c'mon, now you're a tree?"
22149,"How many more, sir?"
22150,These are my keys.
22151,"I-I said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir."
22152,"No, no. I'm just a kid. Leave me alone!"
22153,"It's ""A-B-C-1-2-3""! It's the easiest song in the world!"
22154,What?!
22155,"Oh, that's ridiculous. How could two people from the same family need therapy?"
22156,Then what do we win?
22157,I dunno. There's something about this noose I just don't like.
22158,I don't know...
22159,Y'see? You see how that boy pushes your buttons?
22160,"Son, you and I are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist."
22161,"Pretty sweet, eh boy?"
22162,"Not bad, not bad. Marge, how much do they pay us for doing this?"
22163,"What the? First we work, then I pay, then I have to eat fruit? Why was I ever born?"
22164,"Honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, I booked us a couples massage."
22165,"When we get home, the peaches will be gone."
22166,"Masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything."
22167,My ear makes money?
22168,"Hello, boat store? I'd like to order a boat. What do you mean, dial tone?"
22169,Let's see what else you've been hiding in there.
22170,I want my pot of gold!
22171,I forgot why I'm doing this.
22172,"Lisa, don't feel bad. Judas betrayed Jesus but he still got paid."
22173,I can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. I'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!
22174,"Hey, let me down! This is gonna leave a diamond pattern on my skin!"
22175,"Okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. So why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down."
22176,"I'll save you, Lisa!"
22177,The real magic is raising three kids in this economy! You can put the ball back now.
22178,"And, here you go. ""Do not give your coat to--"" Dammit!"
22179,"I was standing in this line to use the bathroom, but now my license is expired."
22180,Hmm...
22181,Boy that's good.
22182,Woo hoo! First in line! Brought you a gift bag.
22183,And we've got front row seats!
22184,"Well, well, well, if it isn't ""before"" and ""after."" Blob and Blob Lite. Tweedle Yuck and Tweedle Blecch."
22185,Fat Tony! I was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend... while insulting her hideous twin.
22186,Oh my God!
22187,You are cruel but fair.
22188,I'm trying. I swear I'm trying.
22189,Dammit!
22190,"Yes! I'm so happy I lived to see this day! He did give her the kiss of death, right?"
22191,I decorated her car for nothing.
22192,Lousy Saint Louis Cardinals. Can't win the nineteen eighty-five World Series on Classic Sports.
22193,"Fat Tony! Are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at Christmas? And then an old Italian nun finds it. And she's all... No, no, no, oh, no, no! He's too beautiful to die! Ohhhh!"
22194,"Hm. So, should I bring a towel?"
22195,"Um, I take a special size."
22196,"Come on, Bart. We've been out here for hours."
22197,Maybe we've found all the truffles. The only thing I've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.
22198,I'll dispose of those for you.
22199,"Yeah, that's his thing. Anyway, Fat Tony and I think this is a chance to patch things up between you and Selma. Plus it's a free weekend at the beach."
22200,Selma? Va-va-va-wha?!
22201,"Well, if you insist."
22202,You are such a gentle kisser.
22203,HEY!
22204,Wouldn't they be girls?
22205,You know -- it had that painting of that lady and the monster on the ceiling.
22206,He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?
22207,I'll just sit here quietly.
22208,Sorry.
22209,How could Tony cheat on me so soon?
22210,"Y'know Selma, from what I've seen here, Fat Tony has a lot of bad influences on him. I walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money."
22211,"Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled."
22212,"I don't wanna be ""that guy,"" but Marge is making me be ""that guy."""
22213,"That's a wife ring? Marge, don't look!"
22214,"You were right, Marge. These people are not for us."
22215,Which is lucky for me because you're always right.
22216,"I get to enjoy this, but I'm not responsible."
22217,"Actually, Dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too."
22218,"What do I do? Patty's gonna kill me! Unless... I kill her first! I put the body in the car, I dump the car in the lake, I put a James Taylor CD in the stereo so they think it's a suicide..."
22219,"Fine, whatever."
22220,I'll just keep cutting till I hit something solid.
22221,"And now, to break the news as gently as I know how."
22222,Wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!
22223,What happened to you?
22224,Who undid my do?
22225,That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.
22226,You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
22227,And stay out!
22228,"Lady, I'm not a hairdresser -- I just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans."
22229,"A hundred dollars?! Marge, how much is that in smackaroos?"
22230,Woo hoo!
22231,"Well, I open a lot of crazy things when I'm drunk, but I don't think so."
22232,"Just call me ""Homer Fingerhands."""
22233,"Marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. It's like a beloved dog that died on your head."
22234,"Now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, I dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe I should open a hair salon."
22235,Yeah. But what if I can't find any commercial rental property?
22236,"Oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?"
22237,"I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk."
22238,Not a good time.
22239,"Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa."
22240,Is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?
22241,Oh?!
22242,These are really good scissors.
22243,"All day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and I have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face."
22244,When I look at you -- all I see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! Foibles! Foibles! FOIBLES!
22245,"Sorry Sarah, I'm retired."
22246,I'd like to see you try.
22247,Excuse me.
22248,Come on! Would you--
22249,"C'mon, bro, don't hassle me!"
22250,"Stop that. Okay, okay. You win. I'll teach you how to make love to your wife!"
22251,Right.
22252,"I can't. They won't let me. Lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands."
22253,Suck! Of course!
22254,"Oh my God. Like Mozart and Johnny Knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped!"
22255,There's only one way out -- I'm committing Barbicide!
22256,Why doesn't anything kill me?
22257,"Marge, do you hear it? Listen! It's the hair -- growing! Always growing! Blonde, brunette... auburn!"
22258,I'm afraid it's all too true. My wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!
22259,Another hairdresser?
22260,"Aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life Warren Beatty lived in ""Shampoo."" And now it's time to pay you back..."
22261,As long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.
22262,"I love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?"
22263,Awww...
22264,And these keys are from all my jobs.
22265,"Cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? You will?!"
22266,Time for a shortcut.
22267,Woo hoo!
22268,Fine.
22269,"Uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way."
22270,Morning.
22271,Who's alone in the vehicle?
22272,"Uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car."
22273,Maggie!
22274,"Well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. This is from a gas station men's room. They put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. These are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--"
22275,"Stop who, Marge? Be specific."
22276,"Well, it might have been the time when..."
22277,No.
22278,Or maybe I just found them on the ground.
22279,Oh my God... there's the fire brewer... the beechwood ager... the rat filter...
22280,"The Duff blimp! Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing."
22281,"Really, Duff blimp? You really want me to?"
22282,"Oh, what the hell? Life is made to be lived. I've been buttoned down too long!"
22283,When we see each other again you'll be an old man and I'll be a baby!
22284,Hm. Is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? Maybe I can find the answer by texting.
22285,"Yo, Lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking..."
22286,What was that?
22287,"So long, suckers!"
22288,"Hey, kids!"
22289,If I tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? Don't drink it!
22290,But there's so many buttons!
22291,"Bart, take the controls!"
22292,Blimp Assassin Three.
22293,Xbox.
22294,"Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!"
22295,"I'll save you, honey!"
22296,Boy! Stomp on my head!
22297,You're a real jerrrk!
22298,Why you undead little...!
22299,"That doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. He could be a war hero."
22300,All pooted out.
22301,It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present.
22302,Little help...
22303,But you learned! You grew!
22304,I thought I was.
22305,Awww...
22306,"Little help... little help... Flanders, little help?"
22307,"Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry."
22308,Little help...
22309,"Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy will put Jack back in the box."
22310,"Okay, time to go back in the... night-night... This is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... I thought we had a deal, man!"
22311,"Well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. That's a burn on you, Flanders."
22312,"Whoa! Flanders, this chick does not get our thing!"
22313,"Yeah, language."
22314,"Marge, tell her how I don't push Ned around."
22315,"Hey Ned, can I borrow some hair?"
22316,"Don't panic, son. We can bust up Teachy and Preachy. Here's what we do: I'll take Flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. You scare Rod and Todd by telling them Krabappel will become their evil stepmother."
22317,Just the opposite of real life.
22318,"Yeah, isn't this place great? If you're single you can come here every night."
22319,"Ned, let's cut to the chase."
22320,"Ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' Edna, then I don't wanna be brainheaded."
22321,"Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude."
22322,"Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss."
22323,"Ned, I have a confession to make: I may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you and Edna the best."
22324,Fellow barflies! To Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel!
22325,Shut up.
22326,"Guys, quit telling the truth!"
22327,"Um... uh... So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says ""Walk This Way"" was inspired by ""Young Frankenstein?"""
22328,"Don't you mean ""neighboreeno?"""
22329,"You stupid jerks! I can't believe you could be so cruel! Especially you, Joey Kramer!"
22330,"I've got some bad news for you, Marge. I'm actually not."
22331,"Wha? My doctor said ""don't walk."""
22332,"Flanders, hold up!"
22333,"I know, I know you're not comfortable with all the guys Edna's seen around town."
22334,"Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!"
22335,"And didn't the Easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" And if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and Edna can find a way to make it work."
22336,"There's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name."
22337,Right. Teasing.
22338,I'm waitin' for ya.
22339,"Also, if you wanna find the real shooter of Mr. Burns, go back and look for more clues. They're all there!"
22340,"Yeah, right. A baby shot a guy."
22341,QUIET STEPS ARE WHAT I TAKE / SNEAKING IN AT NOON...
22342,JUST IN TIME FOR MY LUNCH BREAK / GOT MY FORK AND SPOON
22343,"TIME THE CAMERAS JUST RIGHT,"
22344,DUCK IN THE BATHROOM.
22345,"I'M STILL DRUNK FROM LAST NIGHT, / GOT DRIVEN HOME, I DON'T KNOW BY WHOM."
22346,"SOME MAY SAY / I DON'T DESERVE ANY PAY, BUT HEY / I CAME UP WITH ""SIXTIES DAY"""
22347,LAST MAY!
22348,"While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out..."
22349,"Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime."
22350,"Larry, my man!"
22351,"Hey, you're not Larry. How come you're not Larry?"
22352,"Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that..."
22353,The warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.
22354,Wha?!
22355,Sheez!
22356,"Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry?"
22357,Good ol' Larry.
22358,"Say... Wayne, I couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. You want to go grab a beer after work?"
22359,"Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping."
22360,"As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped."
22361,"No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay."
22362,"I love you so much! Potatoes and gravy on the side, please."
22363,"Charlie, wanna grab a beer?"
22364,Oh. Okay.
22365,Wayne!
22366,Want a ride?
22367,"You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name."
22368,"Look, I'm not weird or anything, I just like to feel like I'm friends with everybody."
22369,But what if the weathergirl--
22370,Men's room? Oh my god! We're completing each other's...
22371,Completing each other's... sen... ten... cesss...
22372,Wayne?
22373,"Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome."
22374,"Oh c'mon, stay for dessert!"
22375,Sure. Why not.
22376,It's best to concentrate on what you do have.
22377,"Wayne, stop! That's Mr. Burns."
22378,Why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?
22379,"Of course. I mean, how long could it be?"
22380,"That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future."
22381,That robot took our jobs!
22382,He said it.
22383,Or maybe it was him.
22384,"Man, this robot really gets me."
22385,"Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's."
22386,"Neh, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or urinating."
22387,"Not the one you're thinking of, there's another one."
22388,WASHIN' OUT THE DOG POO / SURE BEATS PICKIN' IT UP / FLANDERS' DRIVEWAY IS MY GOAL...
22389,"Oh, he's gone. I don't know where he went."
22390,He has no friends.
22391,Except me!
22392,"Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured..."
22393,Hey! Wha?! Wha?! Wha?!
22394,"No, not the middle seat!"
22395,Death to America!
22396,Fine. I am being held somewhere in the Springfield area. Turn the card.
22397,What will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
22398,"Oh, well way to make me feel obsolete."
22399,"Oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. Think, geniuses."
22400,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?"
22401,This is no way to treat the talent!
22402,Cold. So cold.
22403,So cold. Warm me up.
22404,Just let me put my hands under your armpits.
22405,So much violence on the surface world. I'm going back.
22406,Cold. So cold.
22407,"Aww, that's what I call closure!"
22408,They always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.
22409,I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
22410,Don't buy it! I bought one last year and it was crap construction!
22411,Paddles down! It's the only way to change the system!
22412,"Why of course! Even if I don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do."
22413,"Here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... Ooh, I need more cash. Better go to my invisible ATM."
22414,What? Two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
22415,"Bart, I wanna ask you about something I read in a magazine. Are you boys cyberbullying each other?"
22416,"Marge, I parented!"
22417,"Later, losers."
22418,"Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse."
22419,"Marge, my ice cream's melting and I haven't finished my brownie!"
22420,You guys need to get a woman.
22421,Are you covering me up?!
22422,"The least I can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. It's kind of my way of sending a Christmas card. Happy Holidays, everyone! Family's fine!"
22423,I'm fine.
22424,Okay... I'm on the floor... I can't move... so far a normal Sunday morning.
22425,This is so horrible -- I can't speak...
22426,"How did this happen? Last thing I remember, I was decorating the house for Halloween."
22427,"Ah, Halloween. The one time of year when the squalor of our home works to our advantage."
22428,Where's that spider?
22429,"Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. A real spider would get so mad if I did this! I wonder if this thing has batteries."
22430,It's alive?!
22431,Ow!
22432,Ow!
22433,"Well, at least I still look good."
22434,"Oh, Marge. This is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!"
22435,Oh my God! She's still on the first sentence! Must make her stop... how to express my...
22436,"I guess my life isn't so bad. With the help of my loving family, I even published my first book...and I've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!"
22437,"Oh man, what's this bite gonna do? My wrists are tingling... I feel new powers surging within me..."
22438,"...I want you to find out what's making that funny noise in Homer Simpson's car. It's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. But you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. And you never hear it when you take it to the shop."
22439,"You forgot Patty and Selma. Oh, wait. That hasn't happened yet."
22440,"Now, how would that work?"
22441,"Okay, Stupid Flanders, first I want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave Homer Simpson a cone that had a little air in it."
22442,Come on! God does crazy things! Check your Old Testament.
22443,"Hey Bart... I mean, Jesus. Hey son, you want Flanders to kill anybody? He's totally in my power."
22444,And I sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
22445,"Yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?"
22446,Language.
22447,Why you little!... /
22448,"""In the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete--"
22449,A woman of stature!
22450,"Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately."
22451,But I guess I should find out a little bit about you.
22452,So your dad has money to lend?
22453,This is where we get our coffee. Just leave a little at the bottom so someone else has to make the next pot. The burning smell will let them know.
22454,"Uh-oh, it's Old man Burns!"
22455,"Hello, Young man Burns."
22456,That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.
22457,Oh well!
22458,"Thy will be done, Lord Vader. Please don't hurt me. Please."
22459,Awww...
22460,"Marge, get my seal club! The big one!"
22461,Life imitates Flart.
22462,Hm.
22463,Why would a Homer Humiliator do this to me?
22464,"Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort."
22465,"Oh, uh, Roz, I have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. Could you cover for me?"
22466,"Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!"
22467,I thought of it first.
22468,"Marge, I just saw the greatest movie. Guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! I'll give you a clue, it's funny!"
22469,Someone snitched? Wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
22470,Up or down?
22471,Don't tell my wife.
22472,"I'm telling you guys, Roz told Old Man Burns I ditched work early and now I'm her assistant."
22473,What the-- This is a gentleman's club!
22474,This is terrible. What am I gonna do?
22475,"Can't, Marge. I'm fighting for my professional life here."
22476,"Do you know what I just learned? My job is the reason I get those checks every week! And now that I'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! Not in physical size, but--"
22477,Am I early?
22478,"Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say ""I used to look like this..."""
22479,You're mean!
22480,Can one of the hundred be making the list?
22481,Can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?
22482,"Do this, do that. Lousy Roz, thinks she's so big..."
22483,Hey.
22484,"I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason."
22485,Is this her?
22486,C'mon. The apple must be wreaking havoc with the Twinkie!
22487,"Are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?"""
22488,"That's it! That's it! My nightmare is over! Oh Flanders, you are my personal savior!"
22489,Hail Flanders! Mightier than Jesus!
22490,"Congratulations, Roz."
22491,"Uh, I just came to say that you're perfect. So perfect, I think Mr. Burns should give you a hug."
22492,"I won't say, but his initials are S.F."
22493,Hug! Hug! Hug!
22494,I don't know what that middle word means.
22495,What is perception?
22496,No.
22497,Little help?
22498,Need more butter! And not the unsalted.
22499,"This Saturday, from the Dad who brought you ""cemetery paintball"" and ""go-karts on real roads,"" comes the greatest activity yet..."
22500,And check these out...
22501,Is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?
22502,"Wow, video games sure have changed since I was a kid. How many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? Thirty thousand? Certainly not fifty."
22503,I won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
22504,"Man, how many quarters does this game take?"
22505,"And we're in Hall D. Three halls, three minutes..."
22506,No problem.
22507,Out of my way! / Move it! / Geeks must yield to normals!
22508,Woo-hoo!
22509,I need a nap!
22510,Yeah I was on today. Scary on.
22511,"Look, honey, a family's like a team. And on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee."
22512,"Okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a Saturday Surprise Dad Day."
22513,"That's good, Marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system."
22514,Here's what I do: pick the thing that Marge would hate the most...
22515,"Marge, the kids are acting ethnic!"
22516,"Oh no, I don't eat anything new unless I've eaten it before!"
22517,"I don't want to think about food, I want to like it. Why drive across town to ""savor"" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different Krustyburgers we can see from our house?"
22518,"Oh, and here's my favorite restaurant: ""la fridge!"" It's open twenty-four hours a day and there's no dress code!"
22519,"All right, food nerds, reality check..."
22520,"All the food in those pictures is poop by now. Minds blown, you're welcome."
22521,I'll remind you kids what real fun is!
22522,And I've got tickets for the grand opening Saturday night!
22523,"Pine needle... sorbet... Pine needle sorbet!! My kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it ""sherbert"" and they wish it was ice cream!"
22524,"Fine. Blow off ""Fun Dad,"" go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs."
22525,Jealous? Me?! That is to laugh! The very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
22526,Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!
22527,Too sad to walk! Too sad and fun to walk...
22528,"When I'm sad, I make baseball bats."
22529,Really? You'd let me in on your thing? Even though I think it's stupid?
22530,"Hand me that saw, Marge!"
22531,"When I'm happy, I make birdhouses!"
22532,Kids! Guess what? Mom invited me to your fancy dinner!
22533,I guess Fun Dad is a foodie now!
22534,Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!
22535,Fun Dad is a foodie now!
22536,This is my thing and always will be!
22537,Fun me... fun me... fun me...
22538,"You know, I'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. Maybe I'll like it."
22539,"Well, actually, I've come around on hipsters. Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat."
22540,"So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun."
22541,"East Oak Street, is that it?"
22542,Here it is: 1501 East Oak. No name on the door -- very trendy.
22543,Is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?
22544,The experience begins!
22545,Just like Marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. The open kitchen is a nice touch.
22546,"I guess I'll get started before my family gets here. How much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?"
22547,"Ouch, this place is fancy."
22548,Hipsters... Too cool for school...
22549,"Well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but I'm gonna prove her wrong."
22550,I'm doing this for my family!
22551,This better be dinner theater!
22552,Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!
22553,Sorry!
22554,Now that's my kind of foam.
22555,"Here's fifty bucks. For the next two hours, I don't want to know you exist."
22556,Family fun day.
22557,Ex-tinct!
22558,"We're not here for you, we're here for Lenny."
22559,"Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?"
22560,"All right, you can each have one toy."
22561,"All right, that's it! Forget it! No toys for anyone!"
22562,Okay -- Maggie gets a toy!
22563,I've waited my whole life to hear that!
22564,So tired... go on without me.
22565,It's not against the law to sleep in a Tyrannosaurus head!
22566,I demand to speak to my paleontologist!
22567,A million bucks?
22568,I know five idiots!
22569,"The perfect crime, eh?"
22570,A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
22571,We're taking down kids who read.
22572,I'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
22573,Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.
22574,You're the Zephyr.
22575,It won't be like Kansas City.
22576,"Come on beautiful, I can't do the job without you, so what do you say?"
22577,The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
22578,Do you have a computer?
22579,You're in.
22580,"Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville."
22581,"Wait, you're gonna be all the guys? How would that work?"
22582,"Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!"
22583,The king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
22584,But why?
22585,"I just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is."
22586,The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy.
22587,"Yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript."
22588,Woo-hoo!
22589,"We know, we wrote it."
22590,"Stupid, stupid, stupid! We forgot to create a fake author!"
22591,Or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.
22592,No.
22593,"Gentlemen! To ""The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy!"""
22594,"So, does this square us for Kansas City?"
22595,"How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!"
22596,"But the trolls were the best part! Do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?"""
22597,"Oh, that is so untroll-y!"
22598,British Fonzie is right. Our story is actually more important... than money.
22599,Somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
22600,Kansas City.
22601,Woo-hoo! All right!
22602,"Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something."
22603,"Hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you."
22604,You switched the drives?
22605,So... why are you here? Is it about that unauthorized Krusty lookalike I hired for Lisa's first communion? What was his name?
22606,This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.
22607,"Mr. Burns, so glad you're here! Finally the party can get started!"
22608,"Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke."
22609,"C'mon, just pick a popular song."
22610,"Just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog."
22611,GOING UP SHE GOES! UP SHE GOES!
22612,"...So he says, ""Bigamy is having one too many wives."" To which I replied, ""So's monogamy."""
22613,"It's never good. I always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet..."
22614,"The last thing I understood in that was ""pants."""
22615,"Well, in that case..."
22616,Woo hoo! No more church!
22617,"So long, Sector 7-G...hello, Sector 22-F!"
22618,"You know, you're kind of a downer."
22619,I thought you were retiring. Why are you still here?
22620,"Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?"
22621,"I see. Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?"
22622,"I am really enjoying this, but, um... Hello! Meeting with the Mayor?"
22623,Awww... bourbon go bye-bye.
22624,"Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect."
22625,"Wow, I can't believe I'm eating steak with the Mayor. The next time I vote for you it's gonna be on purpose."
22626,I've outgrown you!
22627,"Ah, Mr. Mayor! More peanut nore?"
22628,"Wow, these seats are amazing."
22629,Bo-ring.
22630,"God, what a great game! And you too can be on the winning team, Mr. Mayor. The Springfield Nuclear Team."
22631,I can't believe that was work!
22632,"Oh, well..."
22633,I really should look at this picture a little longer.
22634,"Okay, let's go."
22635,Can you be my dad?
22636,"It's a rat race, but it looks like I won."
22637,"Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you."
22638,And kiss.
22639,"Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today."
22640,Close enough.
22641,My work is so meaningless.
22642,"You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it."
22643,"It already is killing me, Marge. You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it."
22644,"My job is my wife. Loneliness, my mistress. Despair, my sex buddy. Angst is a chick I met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy."
22645,You don't understand me. Only she understands me.
22646,"Another round, kid?"
22647,Uh... I got here after you did.
22648,"Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking..."
22649,"Of course, of course. Family is everything to us company men. Now, where shall we go on your vacation?"
22650,"That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children."
22651,You're not a client. You're the client.
22652,I'll handle it. I always do.
22653,"Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?"
22654,Oh no you don't.
22655,"It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is."
22656,"Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me."
22657,"Oh Marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into."
22658,"Not sure what you're going for, but"
22659,"Uh... Marge, why don't I catch us some salmon?"
22660,"Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in."
22661,"So, everybody good?"
22662,"Uh-oh. If you've got that, then..."
22663,Enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid!
22664,This family time is so precious. Gotta go.
22665,"Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep..."
22666,My co-workers are like a family. But in some ways my family is like a family too...
22667,Whose side are you on?
22668,"Thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun."
22669,"Hey kids, I'm it!"
22670,I'm okay! And I found some gold!
22671,"Yep, your worries are over. I'm back to being a boring old Safety Inspector at a nuclear power plant."
22672,It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?
22673,Bart! Thank God I had this in my pocket.
22674,My pants are splitting wide open!
22675,And people will see my tattoo of Donald Duck smoking a doob! That was for Marge's eyes only! Oh my God!
22676,Fatso Flanagan!
22677,Only the funniest black-and-white man ever!
22678,"Everything's a rip-off of ""The Honeymooners."" Margie, you're the greatest."
22679,They were so childless and miserable.
22680,How would you know?
22681,"Now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?"
22682,Would I!
22683,Now I hate him too.
22684,What about mimes?
22685,"Good one, boy."
22686,Everything's perfect about the past except how it led to the present!
22687,"Wow, I can't believe we're in the audience of a pay-cable show!"
22688,"I'll never eat turkey again. Marge, we got any ham?"
22689,Christmas card photos?!!
22690,"Are we done yet? ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is about to start. I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd never seen that movie..."
22691,Shut up!
22692,"Oh Marge, how would you like some ""future sex""?"
22693,I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.
22694,"Ooo, a b-mail!"
22695,"Hey, I got a b-mail too! ""You have won a valuable prize! Open now""..."
22696,Too late!
22697,"Yeah, after I stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles."
22698,I'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.
22699,"No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke."
22700,Who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?
22701,"Hey, sweetie. Marge said there was some family tension. And at Christmas of all times."
22702,"""Bloody Harry"" -- he brought back beheading in a big way! Now, I'm gonna show these boys downtown Springfield."
22703,"No, don't worry, I have my invisibility cloak. Now where did I put it?"
22704,This is where my father is.
22705,"He froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure."
22706,"Oh, they found it. But don't tell him. This is way cheaper than a nursing home."
22707,"Dad, these are your great-grandsons."
22708,See you next Christmas!
22709,"To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em."
22710,"Your Dad may be a little immature, but I know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance."
22711,Is it snowing down here?
22712,"If those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe I can forgive..."
22713,"I love you, Dad."
22714,Finally. The only thing I wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.
22715,I just don't understand the world of grownups.
22716,Absolutely. Let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.
22717,High school yearbooks...
22718,Don't argue in front of the airport line. Strangers are judging our marriage!
22719,"Marge, do we really need all these feminine products?"
22720,"Yes, but I never use that kind of toothpaste!"
22721,Try to catch one on your tongue.
22722,Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.
22723,"Now, if I fart, that's 'cause I'm so relaxed."
22724,Yes there is! Woo hoo.
22725,Huh? What the--
22726,But I have to go to the bathroom!
22727,Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!
22728,Airlines don't treat people like people anymore!
22729,You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!
22730,Never putting me next to a pretty girl...
22731,"Look, all I want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment!"
22732,"You can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! And why is there moisture between the windows?! And don't wake me up to land! Just land!"
22733,I regret nothing... except this part!
22734,"I'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'Cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. I..."
22735,You can't check my spirit!
22736,And why is there moisture in between the windows?!
22737,And don't wake me up to land!
22738,What gave me away?
22739,"Because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, I can't go out in public."
22740,"They love me! The quiet Homer Simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. This is the birth of Homer Simpson, blowhard! I'm on the roll of my life! Gimme a scratcher!"
22741,Give me another one!
22742,Almost a winner!
22743,Woo hoo! I'm famous again!
22744,"Well, if I could explain myself..."
22745,Yes. Yes! Got it!
22746,Not so fast!
22747,"Now, I may not be some mani-pedied TV blowhard..."
22748,"But I do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. I bet Chuck the cameraman and Steve the sound guy know where I'm coming from."
22749,"Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! Those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! Honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing Americans!"
22750,"Aw, son. Now I regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked."
22751,Finally. But I want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.
22752,"Welcome to ""Gut Check With Homer Simpson""! Where the truth is served, with a side of in your face!"
22753,I am Homer Simpson.
22754,America's latest teller of truth with a book deal on the side.
22755,Audio book read by Lenny. I'm not just another loudmouth. I'm a loudmouth who says things you're afraid to say BUT NOT RACIST THINGS!
22756,Let's go to the map.
22757,"Zoomy, zoomy, zoomy Dateline, Nebraska."
22758,"A high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!"
22759,Goodnight and good gravy.
22760,"Are you ready for Irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""Oh, that's a lovely touch! Oh, such beautiful form!"" If we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, Rudys, Ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! Ochocincos..."
22761,"Oh yeah, that's right. It's already happening, people. Hoard your toilet paper! Shoot the mailman! Shoot the mailman!"
22762,This is going so great. I'm already a Halloween mask.
22763,It's still a great honor!
22764,"Great question. I know you children have never seen your father cry before... Marge, do we have any more gravy?"
22765,Why? Oh why?
22766,"Oh Marge, don't worry. People know I'm doing a character, like Stephen Colbert, or Newt Gingrich."
22767,"Welcome back to ""Gut Check."" I have something very, very pro-American to share with you. Come with me."
22768,"Death to America! I mean, over here."
22769,"You all know I'm a big fan of American meat. Although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle."
22770,"Take that, centers of art and commerce. And this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. That's right, I'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!"
22771,"When March Madness spills into April -- that's the gravy! When someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! When you stick your flag in the moon and say ""now we're done tryin'"" -- that's the gravy!"
22772,So get on the boat... the gravy boat.
22773,"Great show, people. Great show. Um... Not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? Not a big deal."
22774,Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.
22775,"Don't worry, sweetie. I think I know how to whip up an audience just short of a frenzy."
22776,"Marge, I'm going to meet with the Republican establishment and pick their nominee! If there's sandwiches there, you want me to bring some back?"
22777,Then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?
22778,Only one hundred percent?
22779,"Now Lisa, I'm an entertainer. And you can't entertain and inform at the same time. And if you're Access Hollywood, you do neither!"
22780,I don't know. Can't we get Chris Christie to run?
22781,"Eh, maybe I'll vote democrat. The great thing is when they get in they act like Republicans."
22782,Ted Nugent! I made love on my honeymoon to your sweet music. You're my man.
22783,"Oh, yes."
22784,Huh? Who's there?
22785,Mozart!
22786,Can we get some pizza on the way?
22787,They sell some at the gas station.
22788,"So, how come your picture's not on money?"
22789,Do you give 'em out for fans? 'Cause I'm a fan.
22790,What's this? Some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?
22791,Nerds! You want I should mess 'em up?
22792,But gravy is the freedom where--
22793,Congress shall have the Power To lay and collect Taxes... no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other Staaaate...
22794,"No, no, John Hancock! I don't need insurance! Sam Adams, I'm sorry I made fun of your winter ale!"
22795,"It was all a dream! Oh Marge, Oscar Madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!"
22796,"Lisa, you were right! I'm not going to endorse anybody for anything!"
22797,"Yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this?"
22798,Springfield Colonial Village?!
22799,What the?
22800,"You faked it?! Lisa, how could you?!"
22801,That's what a play within a play is for!
22802,"Well, if there's one thing I don't like being taught, it's a lesson. I'm so mad. Not only will I endorse Ted Nugent...but I will call for an end to the direct election of senators."
22803,Really? That made sense? Then I'm definitely doing it.
22804,"Folks, because I love democracy so much, I command you to vote for this man whom I alone have selected as your next President:"
22805,"Now to baptize his candidacy with my tears. The words ""strutting stadium rocker"" are overused these days, but when I first met Ted Nugent..."
22806,What? My emotions were so powerful...
22807,It's not working... But why?
22808,"Oh my God, she's right. My lips will say anything, but my eyes know the truth. My ears are keeping their mouth shut."
22809,My fellow Americans... I am full of crap.
22810,I GOT A GOOD SONG FEVER / A TED NUGENT FEVER / SOMETHING SOMETHING FEVER...
22811,I GOT THIS SONG FEVER
22812,WE GOT AMERICA FEVER / WE GOT AMERICA FEVER!
22813,"U.S. OF A! Great song, Ted. When's our next gig? Are we goin' to New York, or--"
22814,Leave her alone! That's my only talking daughter!
22815,Down in front!
22816,Dammit! Why do kids have heads?
22817,But I'm invested in the characters.
22818,I make my own turnoffs.
22819,"And that, kids, is how you stick it to the Towne Centre Real Estate Investment Trust. No, no, no. Woo hoo!"
22820,"No, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. Everyone act like we're buckling up to go home."
22821,"Marge, if you were married to Da Vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to Da Vinch."
22822,Leaving? Why on earth would you think that?
22823,And ours!
22824,"This place is so great. When the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt."
22825,"You try it, Maggie!"
22826,Do-over!
22827,Woo hoo!
22828,Unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
22829,Draw the curtain.
22830,"Sir, as a complexion scientist, I must advise you against using any more. This is the most powerful hydrator we sell."
22831,"Less blathering, more slathering."
22832,I don't trust this place. Where are the cashiers?
22833,I'll take it! Provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.
22834,Sweet!
22835,"This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie."
22836,"Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?"
22837,Let me just download the complete works of Shakespeare.
22838,Now who's the greatest writer of all time?
22839,And I've created something that created something incredibly popular!
22840,You never showed it to me.
22841,I still wanna see it.
22842,Then why did you say it?
22843,Are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
22844,"Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer."
22845,I am sitting here... zero sheets to the wind...
22846,"...counting the moments to closing time when I can stumble home to you. Another round, Moe. Uh-oh. Did I type that? Delete! Delete! Hm, typing ""delete"" does not delete."
22847,What the! That idiot cut me off!
22848,"I'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his SpringFace profile picture to a shot of a monkey. Get that, Marge? A monkey!"
22849,Right. Status update: Homer... is... watching... the...
22850,Marco!
22851,"Come on, Lisa!"
22852,Fish out of water!
22853,"...and that's why I really don't believe there's a God. Thank you, and God bless America."
22854,Well I'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
22855,Witty.
22856,Needs flavor.
22857,That's better.
22858,Oxygen... I need oxygen.
22859,"Oh Marge, this is brilliant."
22860,"We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow stuff up on the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day."
22861,Thanks for reading it to me.
22862,Which one do you want?
22863,"You have the most wonderful Mom in the world, which is why I have no idea where she is or what she's doing."
22864,"That's right, sucker! It's Valentine's Day, and I've got a date with some fastballs!"
22865,"Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there."
22866,I'm getting' closer. It's just within reach.
22867,"Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there."
22868,"Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys."
22869,"So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in Lisa's head?"
22870,"Did you say ""ultimate Frisbee?"""
22871,"Women and shoes, am I right?"
22872,"Don't worry, ladies! I'm-a comin'!"
22873,"You know, I heard if a fat guy stops moving, he floats."
22874,"Sorry, Dad. I was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up."
22875,Then why am I paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
22876,"Lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. Jeez, pick up a book."
22877,Then you have a serious reading problem.
22878,So do your farting now.
22879,"Don't worry. My last words will be ""I can outrun that lion."""
22880,"All right, everybody in!"
22881,Two can play at that game.
22882,I can do this... I can do this...
22883,"Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that!"
22884,And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!
22885,"It's fun, but not as fun."
22886,"Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?"
22887,"Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy."
22888,We won! Woo hoo!
22889,"Now, now, now just a second here! Now, I know we're not perfect. But, uh, I believe it was Sammy Hagar who said--"
22890,"I always thought ""tarred and feathered"" was just a figure of speech."
22891,Good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!
22892,"Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought."
22893,I mean a thousand-year flood!
22894,I mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
22895,"Soda, eh?"
22896,"Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!"
22897,Fine.
22898,Please. Put that down.
22899,Not you! Him!
22900,"We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window."
22901,"Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. I got the ATV's right out back."
22902,Helmet? That's Springfield talk.
22903,Springfield talk!
22904,Private plane crashes.
22905,"Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives."
22906,Well I've got a really big secret for you... I'm not wearing any underwear.
22907,"Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes."
22908,"Pipe down, boy. I'm sneaking you back into Springfield."
22909,"Oh, ""Smithers""!"
22910,"Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! Nailed it!"
22911,Excellent.
22912,"You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you."
22913,Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
22914,Strike! Woo hoo!
22915,Ever since the day we met.
22916,The old homestead. Remember when we moved in and I talked like this?
22917,There's no sex like fugitive sex.
22918,Someone's downstairs!
22919,All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again?
22920,We hate opera!
22921,Nooo!
22922,Yeah. Non-jerks!
22923,"Well, I've tightened the bolt! I think we're good!"
22924,"This is the outlands, boy. Ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! Power on!"
22925,"I was wrong, there are bad ideas! There are terrible ideas!"
22926,Now I'm over here!
22927,"Hey Lenny, welcome aboard."
22928,"Now, I gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint."
22929,"Let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep."
22930,That's not a choice you get to make.
22931,Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
22932,"Well, I rented that plane."
22933,"True, true."
22934,Yes! Awake! Let's do this!
22935,"You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present."
22936,And brace yourself: I put some thought into it.
22937,It's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper.
22938,"Love?! Your Mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. Because today I'm getting it autographed."
22939,By the box lady herself!
22940,Yeah.
22941,"Man, oh man, look at this place! Finally, a supermarket with a clear premise: island something."
22942,Wow. I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart anymore.
22943,Apu! What are you doing out of your natural habitat?
22944,Friends are the only people you can betray! And you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
22945,Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
22946,"You would do that? Oh my God, this might be a Marge's birthday where I get sex!"
22947,"Wait one sec, Marge. Before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever."
22948,"The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one..."
22949,I repeat. One...
22950,Onnnnnnneee...
22951,...Onnneee... onnneee...
22952,Onnneee.
22953,This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!
22954,A pity kiss?! That tears it! I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!
22955,The phone's dead.
22956,"Normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! Hm, a chew-through. What could have..."
22957,Aw... I mean arrrgh!
22958,You let this monster into our home! Where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
22959,"Why you little... I'm gonna get... No, Homer. You can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... get in that rabbit cage!"
22960,No backtalk! In the cage! Now!
22961,Get in there!
22962,"Son, do you have a minute?"
22963,I've been thinking. I really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. So I'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
22964,What?
22965,"Boy, get out of that cage!"
22966,I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!
22967,Stupid kid.
22968,This isn't comfortable at all! I don't see how a rabbit could possibly--
22969,DRI-VING-TO-WORK!
22970,Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.
22971,"Don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! Geez, it's all over the place. Holy Moly."
22972,"Heard about this thing, boy?"
22973,"Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
22974,"Not now, Marge!"
22975,"Boy, you like this necklace I just bought?"
22976,"Pretty dope, don't you think?"
22977,"Hey Bart, check this out."
22978,"Look at me, I'm Mr. Fatso! It's funny 'cause it's so preposterous."
22979,What the--
22980,What? No! It can't be!
22981,Shut up! I'll fix you!
22982,"Yes, master."
22983,"Here car. Here, boy."
22984,Why you little...
22985,Pay for your genius!
22986,"Oh, what's the use? When a man isn't a hero to his son, he's nothing."
22987,"Well, we do."
22988,You just ruined my car.
22989,"Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy."
22990,"Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?"
22991,"Both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. He's just trying to fit in."
22992,"Chief, I believe I have the answer in the back of my car."
22993,Did you guys see that stupid foul call in the game last night?
22994,Unguarded stuffff...!
22995,"Attention, lovers of free office supplies! Come and steal things you can easily afford!"
22996,"Mr. Burns! Save me, panic!"
22997,Woo hoo!
22998,How ya doin' there?
22999,"Well sir, before I do anything I stop and ask myself, ""What would Jesus and Mr. Burns do?"""
23000,"Y'know boy, my dad used to take me fishing just like this."
23001,More angry texts from work!
23002,"Hey, it's called ""karma."""
23003,A common misconception.
23004,"Suck it, karma! Yeah! I'm talkin' to you, karma! Karma's a bitch, karma!"
23005,"Nothin' better than a lazy Saturday morning, lying in a warm, moist bed. Because weekends are-- Moist?!"
23006,I wet the bed! The one embarrassing thing I've never done!
23007,"Marge, from time to time I've heard you speak of a ""washing"" ""machine."" Where would I find this marvelous contraption?"
23008,"Not just the laundry... That would be weird, and you might ask questions. I wanna do all the chores!"
23009,"Don't yell at me, brain! This happened on your watch! You have two jobs: thinking and bladder control!"
23010,"I like to watch Lamar Odom play X-Box while his giant wife yells at him. Is that so nuts? Huh? Yeah, shut you up."
23011,"Now, I'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. But just to make sure..."
23012,Why can't I cork my wang-wine?
23013,But isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?
23014,"Deep down, I must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! And my problem won't stop till I make things right with them. But first, a little more sleep."
23015,"I'm sorry. Cheese on that? Sorry. Hey, Lenny. Sorry."
23016,"One more announcement: make sure you whack ""piñata me"" and not real me."
23017,"So, I gotta know... do you guys forgive me?"
23018,Free? Uh...
23019,Free it is!
23020,"Thanks, guys. Tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of Mars except for the poles."
23021,What the?! Wet again?! I did the right thing for nothing! There's only one solution left.
23022,Okay... Place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!
23023,Now that's what I call looking out for number one.
23024,"Um, uh... probably just the fire alarm -- try to go back to sleep."
23025,You stupid...
23026,"Son, I'm afraid the Uralarm Whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke."
23027,"Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed."
23028,"Hey, when you were pregnant everything was ""we."""
23029,What?
23030,What about Cupid? He's smokin' hot.
23031,"Marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside."
23032,BUM-BA-BUM-BA / BUM-BA-BUM-BA...
23033,"Hey, guys! Whatcha doing in my dream?"
23034,What do I do?
23035,My brain's fine! In my dreams I'm an intermediate skier!
23036,Ski patrol! Everyone be cool!
23037,"Great, now Death knows."
23038,Um nothing... typical dream nonsense.
23039,I know this dream! It's the land of my innermost thoughts and fondest desires!
23040,"Uh, Marge, this is my friend Keggy..."
23041,Woo hoo!
23042,"Oh, lighten up, Marge. I take you to the Disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the Lost and Found. Well guess what? We're stayin' in this dream forever!"
23043,Whee! I'm in me! / Oh! / I love the down parts! Here comes!
23044,Quick! Gum up the gears with Moes!
23045,"Oh Death, you're a lifesaver!"
23046,"Thank you, Death. And may I ask what's taking so long with Larry King?"
23047,Mom?!
23048,Just like my hair.
23049,"Exactly like Chandler, always criticizing."
23050,Wow!
23051,Roomy.
23052,Why you little...
23053,There's nothing in this dream world that can't strangle you!
23054,You left him because I tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!
23055,"It's true! I failed the basic duty of childhood. And then when I took Bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!"
23056,I'm cured. I'll never wet the bed again.
23057,"No can do, baby."
23058,Goodbye.
23059,"Woo-hoo! I'm dry! Come on, everybody! Feel daddy's underpants!"
23060,So what do I do again?
23061,All right.
23062,"Look at it go! All right! Hey, since it's a dream, let's ride our bikes naked around town."
23063,"It's just dream hail! Ow! Oh! Ow! Dream hail! Hey, there's a dream truck!"
23064,Thank you.
23065,Woo hoo! Thank God it's T.G.I.F!
23066,"You're outta here, drug-o."
23067,Well... I didn't really feel like going to Moe's today... thought I might hang out here for as long as I can take it.
23068,Yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. I did it when I was in that alcohol-induced coma.
23069,"So, what's on the agenda?"
23070,Why did I do that? / It sounds so dull and boring. / What was I thinking?
23071,"What the-- Section 1 of Article 21 of the State Constitution is amended to read: Section 1. In the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of Congress at the beginning of each decade, the Legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of Congressional, State Senate and Assembly districts. Liquor... mustn't think of liquor..."
23072,"So, a sober weekend hasn't been that hard. Let me just take a few antidepressants here."
23073,I feel sorry for people without willpower. I truly do.
23074,A surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.
23075,Then there's champagne in me! What am I gonna do? It's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. Maybe I can sweat it out.
23076,"Oh man, I'd better have some coffee and iced tea."
23077,What about this lemonade?
23078,"Then I'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! Oooh, cake!"
23079,Crepes!
23080,Cherries!
23081,Jubilee!
23082,"Oh Lord, I have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. If you can weasel me out of this physical, I will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. Amen. Now to mumble in a religious fashion. Dear God, oh, Lord oh God, oh, Lord..."
23083,Comicon nerds!
23084,A must!
23085,"Mr. Burns, before I leave, I've got a few things to get off my chest: one: I liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". You don't have to know how long. Two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. Three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. So to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought."
23086,Does the chair go back like this?
23087,Woo hoo!
23088,"Nice parking, idiot."
23089,"So, uh, you guys are my new coworkers."
23090,"So, workin' hard or hardly workin'?"
23091,"I said, workin' hard or hardly working? Working hard or hardly working?! WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?!"
23092,It's a simple question! Are you A: Working hard or B:
23093,"I guess I just met the joker of the group. Better watch out for you on April Fool's Day, am I right? I said, am I right? Am I r--"
23094,So you guys have any luck finding a new job?
23095,"Hey, I've gotta tell ya, I'm miserable there. I'm all alone; and when there's some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?"
23096,Maybe I should be heading home.
23097,"WHEN THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE / LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE / THAT'S AMORE / WHEN THE WORLD SEEMS... When you do chair gondola all by yourself, it almost seems stupid."
23098,"Ah, here it is: Hydraulic systems flush... EEPROM bios autoboot... conversation mode? They can talk?!"
23099,"I just have to press this button, right..."
23100,"Well, at least it doesn't feel pain."

23162,"Huh, that's weird, my armpits are gettin' wet."
23163,Hmm...
23164,Seen it.
23165,Seen it.
23166,Seen it.
23167,British version was better.
23168,Totally scripted.
23169,Sued it.
23170,Stranded? What's that?
23171,"Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima."
23172,A plane crash!
23173,Wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!
23174,What a great opening episode. And I'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!
23175,"You know, I should get back to the treadmill."
23176,"The lava being! That's why they showed a clip of it on ""previously on."""
23177,"Marge, there're so many mysteries that I need to have solved."
23178,"Now, if the Korean couple can't speak English, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was ""enigma"" spelled backwards? What does it mean?"
23179,And where will I watch TV?
23180,And where will I walk?
23181,And where...
23182,We've had stupider!
23183,At last! This episode promises to finally answer one question!
23184,Homie!
23185,The kids are away and Maggie's napping...
23186,"Ooh, that's great! Can it wait another hundred and four hours?"
23187,She walked away and slammed the door. What does it mean? What does it mean?
23188,Oh that's such a first-take answer!
23189,"Thank you all for coming to my ""Stranded"" discussion group!"
23190,"Spoiler alert! I've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: ""Coconut Cream Die."""
23191,Spoiler!
23192,Spoil-er!
23193,"I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just a Strandie discussion group. Yes it is! We discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die."
23194,"Thanks, Marge. You ruined my show. Now I'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now."
23195,"Lousy Marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his TV show... I'd tell my best friend, but that's Marge too..."
23196,Well...
23197,"Okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'."
23198,"Again with ""Mr. Steak!"" Do you know why I go to Mr. Steak? Because at Mr. Steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at Mr. Steak!"
23199,Why don't you talk to Mrs. Steak?
23200,Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!
23201,Bart's been raptured! And his crap's been craptured!
23202,"Nice doin' business with you, boy."
23203,What happened to my mini-pool table? I was training to be a mini-pool hustler.
23204,I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
23205,"Oh, Marge... your names..."
23206,"Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""Are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""Is that splashing or drowning?"""
23207,Why does every sand castle require my participation?
23208,Then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...
23209,...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! Which he drops in the water!
23210,And here's the worst part: I never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!
23211,WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT! WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT!
23212,Sex on a family vacation? I never thought such a thing was possible!
23213,And the ocean'll do all of the work!
23214,"Ocean sex rules! Go to Hell, land sex!"
23215,"Boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- ""before you were born"" fun."
23216,"I'unno... Lotta barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell necklaces... they really hid the poverty nicely."
23217,"Worthless, worthless, worthless..."
23218,Can I put my hand through you?
23219,"Yeah, and the customer service on this cruise has really gone downhill."
23220,"Man, I kicked butt in the gladiator arena today! I won the last package of hot dogs on the ship! I got robbed by marauders on the way home."
23221,What about the duty-free stuff we bought?
23222,My booze and cologne!
23223,Choke on my numb blue hands!
23224,"Yeah stupid, stop thinking about fun and have it!"
23225,"Hey, wait for me!"
23226,Now that's what I call going for a spin!
23227,Now that's what I call a snappy retort!
23228,He turned that Russian guy into Swiss cheese!
23229,Looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
23230,"Swiss cheese. Marge, how come you're not saying anything?"
23231,"Oh man, Marge is pissed. Look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head..."
23232,That's what she said!
23233,Yeah.
23234,"No, just my marriage."
23235,"Honey, it's me again. I can't work knowing that you're mad at me. I just wanna hear your voice. And I'm counting the minutes till the whistle blows, then I go to Moe's, then I rush home to you."
23236,But you said it so mean!
23237,"Eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin."
23238,"Hey Marge, here's something that'll make you happy!"
23239,"No, this is really good. I..."
23240,"Now, listen, Lisa--"
23241,"Well, I just got..."
23242,Uh... I got... Shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.
23243,But you're not...
23244,"I have eight weeks paid vacation, and my family doesn't know."
23245,Woo hoo!
23246,"Honey, I'm off to work!"
23247,You know... maybe I should call in sick. We could visit all our old romantic haunts that have closed and turned into temporary Halloween stores.
23248,"I get it. You need your Marge time. Well, I'm off to work."
23249,"My feet hurt, and my neck is cold."
23250,"Man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."
23251,"...and now because it's afternoon, I can go to Moe's without having a ""drinking problem."""
23252,"Well, why can't I hang out at the bar all day? My wife doesn't wanna be with me."
23253,I wish I could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out.
23254,Stradivarius Cain!
23255,What the? Am I losing my marbles?
23256,Sorry.
23257,What the? No one can see you.
23258,"Yeah, Dr. Cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons."
23259,Sometimes Marge says I turn it into a trashcan.
23260,Sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
23261,But I'm a married man.
23262,"Okay, I'll make a stranger love me forever."
23263,My dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'Cause your hair looks really messed up.
23264,You know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. How many hardboiled eggs do you think I can eat?
23265,"When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes."
23266,What do I do? What do I do?
23267,"You're right, Marge. I lied."
23268,"I got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation."
23269,And I spent all that time learning how to be a better husband. The kind of husband you deserve.
23270,The three of us are going to the most romantic restaurant in town.
23271,I have bug-bombed the car for m'lady.
23272,"It was all a training exercise to make me smooth for you. Of course she fell for me and of course I wanted no part of her. Now, the only one who can help us is Stradivarius Cain."
23273,I'll explain later. Strad! Come back! I know you're in there!
23274,"No... not you... next... big fan but no... Cleatus the Football Robot, you're my only hope!"
23275,No one likes you!
23276,"Strad, where are you?"
23277,"When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes."
23278,We used to be like them.
23279,"Actually, I was supposed to be back last week. We'll just wait for the call from human resources."
23280,"Well, I better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy."
23281,I already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
23282,"Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories..."
23283,Game Six of the 2011 World Series...
23284,...And Lenny's story about Cancun.
23285,Just like me on Twitter!
23286,Woo hoo!
23287,I'm your Jesus! Me!
23288,What's that a reference to?
23289,"Ooh, nice and roomy. Our Lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool."
23290,"Yes, sweetie?"
23291,Whee! Whee!
23292,"Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee."
23293,"Oh Lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?"
23294,Does Jesus have a big part in this thing?
23295,What?! Why do I succeed at everything I audition for?
23296,Thou sayest it!
23297,They cannot judge me. Only my Father can judge me.
23298,"I'll take you with me, old man!"
23299,"Mmm, historically inaccurate."
23300,Ooo!
23301,What the?
23302,"Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves."
23303,"Tonight, you shall be at my right hand in Heaven."
23304,"Outta my way, stupid Flanders!"
23305,Uh-oh.
23306,"Ooo, licorice!"
23307,Welcome to marriage! Another good man bites the dust.
23308,I'm talkin' about this guy.
23309,I sure envy him.
23310,"I mean I envy Flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage. Let's put it to a vote, America."
23311,Bart! Don't call me that!
23312,"Why you little... they're both bad, and I suspect you know it!"
23313,People here do not respect boundaries.
23314,Sorry.
23315,"Great, we'll take care of everything. We'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners."
23316,"You really put on a great reception, Marge. It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller."
23317,"He took the time to press the shift key, Marge! I think he knows what he's talking about."
23318,"Oh Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies."
23319,Not according to the internet!
23320,I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
23321,Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!
23322,And what he says is true because it's in all caps. Are you gonna argue with caps?
23323,"Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry."
23324,Don't tell me what our thing is.
23325,"I've always said ""hungry""!"
23326,I thought I heard clicks and pops!
23327,"Welcome, money-changers! You can trust Sleazy Sam for the best rates, or my name isn't Jesus H.--"
23328,Are you gonna do that every time I open one of these?
23329,WILL YOU STOP THIS STUPID CRAP? / I WANNA TAKE A NAP!
23330,What's wrong with her?
23331,Where are they going with this?
23332,You wanna honk your jazz tube?
23333,I appreciate that.
23334,"Hey, why don't we go see Lady Gaga? That'll turn your frown upside down."
23335,What are you talking about? Y-you're right!
23336,Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!
23337,"I will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where I always have to get to seventeen. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Whoops, I lost count. Better start again. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!"
23338,"Hey Lisa, come on."
23339,No.
23340,Wow. Wow. This is like the night Hillary won the New Hampshire Primary.
23341,Can I just trim the hem?
23342,"Okay Lisa, comin' up to make things better!"
23343,"Okay, I'm almost there... upward, ever upward... stay hydrated... I'm on the wrong tree... Okay, try again... here we go, okay..."
23344,"Lisa, can you come down?"
23345,"Sweetie, I've been thinking. Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. The problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught."
23346,"I cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. So, honey, what do you say?"
23347,Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.
23348,"I LOVE MY HOMER FACE YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SAID / RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD BE ON THE FRONT OF MY HEAD / STUBBLE, MUZZLE, OVERBITE, TWO EYES THAT REALLY BUG / THESE ARE THE COMPONENTS OF MY HOMER-RIFFIC MUG / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, / I SHAVE IT CLOSE, TRIM HAIRS FROM MY NOSE / D'OH, OOOH, D'OH, OOOH, I CLEAN MY EARS, 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I HEARS / I LIKE MY / I LIKE MY / I REALLY LIKE MY HOMER FACE"
23349,Wait for the gap... wait for the gap...
23350,There's the gap!
23351,Gap's too small!
23352,What's goin' on?
23353,"Boy, if anyone needs me I'll be taking a popcorn bath. It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine in a dream."
23354,"Pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle."
23355,Well... I also keep things interesting.
23356,"You see? Hey, what are you looking at?"
23357,"Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
23358,"Observe. Hey, it's me again. He's there, isn't he? Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird, but I'm inside your closet."
23359,"Hey, it's me."
23360,"I was thinking about you. It's your birthday in like three, four months? Would it be weird if I threw you a party?"
23361,"...And five hundred dollars for Yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus..."
23362,But they're playing the Purple Sox!
23363,"Lousy outdated relics! Boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to New York?"
23364,"You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried!"
23365,"I'm about to go owl shooting... and you just said ""who!"""
23366,"You're sellin' milk, J.J., and I've got a sour stomach."
23367,It didn't feel like success.
23368,"Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. It's all set, boy. To save money, we're swapping houses."
23369,I didn't say I swapped our house.
23370,Look at this place. Things have certainly changed since our ancestor Fievel came here.
23371,"Yes, and now look at us. Only in America."
23372,"Oh, geez. Not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart."
23373,You do that.
23374,Do you know you're missing your clothes?
23375,"All right, I'll spring for a cab."
23376,Much better.
23377,"Oh-oh-oh oh, thank God you woke up!"
23378,"You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. I'll get us some ice cream."
23379,Why you little... where's that ice cream?
23380,Damn you and your fluted neck!
23381,I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!
23382,Go where?
23383,"Boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!"
23384,"Aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be."
23385,"Heh, no kidding, I saw your reviews."
23386,"I hope you enjoyed the show tonight. And if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of."
23387,Do we screw them on the credit?
23388,At least the pennant works both ways.
23389,Lisa! Do you have a stray dog down there?
23390,Two stray dogs?
23391,That was gonna be my next guess!
23392,Maybe.
23393,"A black hole? I'm sorry, can we call it that?"
23394,"Hey, can it open a pretzel bag for me? Help a brother out, B.H."
23395,Woo hoo!
23396,"Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something!"
23397,Why should--
23398,Why you little...
23399,I am nature's perfect choking machine!
23400,Sorry.
23401,Nope. / Not me. / Do we even still have that thing?
23402,"Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""Magic Craphole Waste Removal,"" but it wasn't me."
23403,Treasures? Gifts? You got it all wrong. That stuff is just our old--
23404,Day one.
23405,We've bought this camera because strange things have been going on at our house in the dead of night.
23406,"And if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero."
23407,A hero.
23408,Hero away!
23409,Night One. Wanna snuggle?
23410,I turned it off.
23411,"I swear, I am not filming."
23412,Note to self: edit out my lies.
23413,Wait! Don't kill the monster without me!
23414,"I'm right behind you, honey! We have stairs?!"
23415,What the?
23416,"Oh, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious, invisible being from hell waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them. Now go to bed."
23417,"Eh-eh, school night."
23418,Now you're sure I bought enough cameras and extended warranties to catch that ghost?
23419,"Ooh, I can't wait for tonight's massacre."
23420,"Hey, Marge."
23421,"Oh, like what you see, huh?"
23422,I like it when you don't say words.
23423,"Listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy."
23424,Is there any other deal that you can accept?
23425,"You, me and Marge?"
23426,I guess it's one of those things a dad has to do...
23427,"Now, before we start, what's the safe word?"
23428,"Ooh, I like that. Now, I'd like to try something new if you don't mind..."
23429,Cinnamon!
23430,Would you go to the prom with me?
23431,I'll get right on it.
23432,I'm on it!
23433,"For the third time this year, yes!"
23434,Woo hoo!
23435,"I gotta hand it to you, Marge. You got the exact amount of car for our family. Room for two adults, three kids, and zero Grampas."
23436,Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.
23437,Well...
23438,"So, you're not totally unqualified."
23439,A reason? What could it be?
23440,"Wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth."
23441,Umm... no thanks.
23442,"Marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? Um... um... a ""feelings"" reason?"
23443,"Well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. When do you think things first went wrong?"
23444,"No, no, Marge. I want you to explore your feelings."
23445,"An ""on purpose"" baby?"
23446,"What about... you know... ""Stinky""?"
23447,"Whatever you want, sweetie."
23448,Just appreciating how lucky I am to be with you.
23449,"And let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight."
23450,X's for eyes...
23451,"Honey, I am so sorry. I guess we'll just have to learn to love the three children we have."
23452,"Hey, uh... hm... why don't we take the longer but nicer historic route? Then today will be nothing but beautiful memories."
23453,Sorry guys. Private family moment.
23454,"Eh, nothing we can do."
23455,It's true... that's how I got the money to buy you your necklace.
23456,"I, uh, hope it's twins!"
23457,Watch it!
23458,"Okay, but just for a minute. We want to hit the candle store, Fudgerama, the Zipper Hall of Fame, Snow Globe World, and The Taj Meatball."
23459,And I got to try every flavor of candy cane: white and red.
23460,"What's that, baby?"
23461,"I'll take it from here, wing-man."
23462,"Yeah, no kids to ruin it."
23463,"Marge, I was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda."
23464,"Uh, well, looking back, I guess it started sometime before Bart was born."
23465,"Room for one, please."
23466,"Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids."
23467,"Emotionally, financially, the boy... I just didn't know how to tell you."
23468,"Okay, good, we're talking..."
23469,Your phone just dialed me.
23470,"Hey, the pocket wants what it wants."
23471,"They just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? How about that? That's trust, huh?"
23472,Uh-oh. I don't think I rewound the video the last time I was here.
23473,"Um, I'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a Simpson, Homer. Or it may be under the name Thad Supersperm."
23474,"I'll tell you what I want, Marge. I want to make another Simpson. The table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. Cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. And anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect."
23475,Are you sure there isn't more? I mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.
23476,I'd like to buy back my sample.
23477,"Well, I expected a little argument."
23478,"Geez. I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman, but I'm all right."
23479,Um... remember that Corvette I had?
23480,This is the worst pain imaginable!
23481,"Exactly. Well, we're all set. Let's make a Thad Supersperm Junior. With a name like that, he could be president."
23482,But I was really looking forward to...
23483,"You're right, Marge. I don't wanna bring more kids into a world full of my kids."
23484,"Two adults, please."
23485,Another thing that would be harder with four kids.
23486,Pushy sign! Don't tell me what to try!
23487,I don't recall that.
23488,"One onion rings, please."
23489,This one's cold.
23490,"My burns have affected our... intimacy... because all night, I talk about how much money I'm going to make from the lawsuit."
23491,Oh God! It hurts worse than the burns!
23492,"Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa."
23493,"I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up."
23494,"Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too?"
23495,That settles it. No banks for me.
23496,What the--? I'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
23497,"A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
23498,"Open file, click and...invested! Hey Lisa, check out your college fund!"
23499,"It's a classy operation. See, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. Cute."
23500,On a poker site!
23501,On a poker site!
23502,Sorry. Check out my new t-shirt.
23503,"I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened."
23504,That's one way to avoid drunk driving.
23505,I'm not Superman.
23506,"Ha, of course I do! Happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?"
23507,"What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!"
23508,"Okay, remember the plan. Apologize to Grampa. Then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot."
23509,"Marge, you take that back!"
23510,You take that back!
23511,We're here to see Abe Simpson.
23512,Missing?! What kind of a prison are you people running here?
23513,"Oh, it's hopeless! This room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. By which I mean every museum."
23514,So precious...
23515,"Look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor."
23516,"Flimsy lead, take me away!"
23517,"Excuse me, have you seen this man?"
23518,"I'm just trying to get information -- like a nosey reporter, or an undercover cop..."
23519,"Or a spy from a rival gang! Hey, what are you doin'?"
23520,Did you say my dad worked here?
23521,Wait a minute!
23522,My dad was an aspiring songwriter like Charles Manson? I never knew that.
23523,"Now, what was that singer's name again?"
23524,Rita La-what?
23525,One more time.
23526,Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
23527,That's where we live!
23528,Woo hoo! I get two Christmases!
23529,I can't believe my Dad never told me he had another wife. The man I looked up to my whole life.
23530,"Well, it's a good thing I didn't because I'd be pretty devastated right now."
23531,"But we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. And fast!"
23532,Well just what attracted you to my father?
23533,I was alive when my Dad knew you?
23534,My Dad had furniture?! I don't know him at all!
23535,"Hey, I'm startin' to remember why I don't remember so much."
23536,"Oh my God. I never knew the sacrifices my father made. Move over, Fonzie. I've got a new hero."
23537,Holy moly.
23538,That's Dad's cologne? I always thought it was his old-man stink.
23539,"Man, you're making me hot for my Dad."
23540,"Listen, do you know this man?"
23541,Dad!
23542,"Dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again."
23543,What?!
23544,"And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox."
23545,Aww.
23546,I'm payin' for 'em.
23547,That's how wolves die in the wild.
23548,The day my Frisbee landed in your yard was the luckiest day of my life...
23549,He's a good boy.
23550,What I wouldn't give for an anvil to fall on me.
23551,A perfect storm?
23552,"When I prayed for this concert to be over, I didn't mean like this!"
23553,"I am turning my back, because I can't stand to look you in the face."
23554,Bart! This is America. Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.
23555,"Come on buddy, why would you want to be a murderer?"
23556,Hi... Dan.
23557,Doodie.
23558,Oh?
23559,Oh my God! You want me to help you escape?
23560,You wha?
23561,In my business I try not be seen. I'm scary good at it.
23562,Please stop. I just wanted my Frisbee back from your yard.
23563,This is how I get out of doing the dishes.
23564,"Okay, I don't, I don't know why I said it... I was scared... I needed a response... it was a perfect storm!"
23565,My Dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. And now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. So this should work!
23566,Could you please not sound like you like it so much?
23567,"Now stay down here and I'll be back every hour with food, and every six hours with food for you."
23568,Classic.
23569,Someone must be watching on another TV.
23570,Will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?
23571,"That was four screams! Stupid A.F.I. Boy, never go into their Director's Training Program!"
23572,Now how would you qualify for that?
23573,Have fun getting coffee for Roy Disney the Third.
23574,Dinner time! I know you're hungry! I can hear you rubbing your legs together! Oh my God!
23575,I never thought Homer Simpson would be a part of the Day of the Locust.
23576,Are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
23577,I'll fix that later!
23578,On vacation he digs wells in Darfur!
23579,Stop!
23580,Dan!
23581,You really should tweet less.
23582,Huh? What?
23583,"Just listen. If you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are."
23584,"Look, just give me the gun before you hurt somebody. Give it to me!"
23585,I knew you were weak.
23586,"You are weak, but no."
23587,"No, I don't want to."
23588,I don't want to see it!
23589,"You're making me mad and I want, I want to shoot you now! / I don't have to see it."
23590,Give it to me! / I can imagine it. / Give me the gun! /
23591,"Come on weakling, get it from me."
23592,"Yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now."
23593,"Well, you ain't so--"
23594,"Marge, in a crisis like this, I need time for quiet contemplation."
23595,"I'm in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I'm too cowardly to leave it. Maybe I could drink myself to death."
23596,"Life is too fragile. One minute you're lying in your hammock drinkin' beer, the next thing you know you're sittin' here drinkin' beer."
23597,"Aw, come on Chief, I've had a rotten day. Can't you help me out?"
23598,Now what?
23599,Can this day get any worse?
23600,Dogs can't get mumps.
23601,"Aw, that's Tooth Fairy money down the drain, sweetie. I never win anything. It's always some stupid jerk you've never heard of."
23602,Here it comes...
23603,"Get him! I mean, woo hoo!"
23604,"I just want to say, I was having the worst day of my life."
23605,"Okay, what else... Free Tibet! You heard me! Free him now! Thank you. Oh, my luck has changed!"
23606,I left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.
23607,I don't wanna.
23608,I submit! I submit!
23609,Oh yeah!
23610,"You can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""Tapped Out."""
23611,Virtual Stapler!
23612,"Sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to. Here's one that gives ya a cool '70s moustache."
23613,I'm Sonny Bono. Watch out for that tree!
23614,"So, which do you prefer, m'lady? Tom Selleck, Rollie Fingers or Pringles Man?"
23615,But I'm not alone. I'm doing some Face Time with Lenny.
23616,The old stupid moustache'll win him over.
23617,I'm really stupid.
23618,I'm standing by that.
23619,"Sorry, boss."
23620,Woo hoo!
23621,"Will you kids pipe down! I'm trying to get ""Churro-Chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. What country is Mexico in?"
23622,Okay.
23623,Aww. That'll be my screensaver.
23624,Why you little...
23625,"A paper-based read-a-majig? What are we, cavemen?"
23626,"Sweetie, in the future all you'll need is this."
23627,What would you have me do? One basket for each egg?
23628,"Now, Maggie let's find a good game for us. Hm, ""Krusty's Kosher Karnival""...""Words With Enemies""...""Don't Burn the Toast!"", ""Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break,"" ooh, ""Pizza Clock""!"
23629,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping! Having fun, Maggie?"
23630,How long have I been playing?
23631,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
23632,"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
23633,"Dohhh! Sauce, cheese, topping!"
23634,Flushy! Go get help!
23635,It still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!
23636,Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
23637,"Oh Lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light. Then you switched it off knowing full well I had declined thy infernal Mapple Care. Please grant me the wisdom to understand your capricious, nasty mind. And please, please make the next swing of the yo-yo an up, amen."
23638,Everybody hear that?
23639,"Keep your pants on, Flanders."
23640,Has the MyPad risen?
23641,"This is your miracle? A tree? Ooh, look at me. I turn sunlight into complex sugars. Big whoop."
23642,"Huh. ""Hope."" Is this one of those coincidences like Jesus on a tortilla or George Washington on a dollar bill?"
23643,"Well, this is how God would send me a message. In my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. What do you think he's trying to tell me, Flanders?"
23644,Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.
23645,"Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I'm choosin' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!"
23646,To hope!
23647,"Uh, excuse me, Reverend, but I'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope."
23648,"Hope is here, people, and it's real. It's not just inside the house of God, it's outside the house of me! So come and see the sticky brown truth!"
23649,Hope is all around me!
23650,As promised: the miracle!
23651,I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe it's time to call Satan. Is that a two-one-two?
23652,"Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain."
23653,Who do you think painted the word on the tree?
23654,Guess it must've been the person who knew I needed hope most of all.
23655,"Bart, stop it! You might fall!"
23656,Grampa?!
23657,"This boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! I am his father... I can't believe I allowed you to hit on me."
23658,"Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you! I'm sexy! Young and sexy!"
23659,Old man... I'm not an old man... This drawing doesn't think I'm old.
23660,"Don't you, drawing?"
23661,Those aren't our regular donuts! They're huge... with crazy toppings! Gummy worms! Churro chunks! Russian nesting donut!
23662,Gotta eat the rest!
23663,They're gone!
23664,"Where did these ""Devil Donuts"" come from?"
23665,"Get lost, pervs!"
23666,"Okay, where did you get these donuts?"
23667,I'm calling to report... a missing donut cart.
23668,"No, no, nothing, nope."
23669,I see... devil horns!
23670,"... pitchfork, pointed tail... hooves are... cloven! We have logo, people. We have logo!"
23671,No more donuts?
23672,Beer keg do-nut?
23673,I would be honored to shake the hand that glazed this.
23674,Tell me everything about you.
23675,You're from Portland? I've heard of people being from there.
23676,"Wait a minute, you have kids?! You can't have kids! Look at you!"
23677,"You have a fun job, a skull ring and it's not Halloween... and your belt is a seatbelt..."
23678,No one would ever think you're a lame old man.
23679,Our houses are the cheapest! The one next to me's been on sale forever! I see them lowering the price every morning when I go out to pee.
23680,Please. Please rush into this! Please rush into this!
23681,"In my house, we found human bones."
23682,"Really? I'm... ...cool? Oh, can I man-hug you?"
23683,I don't know how.
23684,"Okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. I've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, I assume -- so don't screw it up."
23685,"Great, Marge, now that's in their heads."
23686,"""Star Wars"" Chewy's just a man in a costume, so he's not scary."
23687,"""T-Rex?"" Even their names are cool! This is, umm... Ice Cream, Bungee Jump, and... Viral Video."
23688,Check out my new look!
23689,Terence shaved my head!
23690,"No, I'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. I never want to see these again."
23691,"Check it out, Flanders, us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard. Guess I can't be your best friend anymore."
23692,"Boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. It's not gonna win me back."
23693,"I have a plan to deal with that. Step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end."
23694,"Honey, I'm not cool. I was never cool. I didn't go to college. Every CD I have I bought at a carwash. Black-and-white films make me angry. I can't pronounce ""artis-anal."" I only know David Cross from the Chipmunks movie. Not only do I like Van Halen, but I think they keep getting better..."
23695,"But if me and my kids do the same stuff as Terence and his kids, I could be a cool dad."
23696,"Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip."
23697,"No, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. That's Terence's parenting style--"
23698,"Well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches."
23699,Wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool. The. Essence.
23700,"Oh man, my goatee has barely come in. Why does my hair only grow in twos?"
23701,I hope T-Rex likes the present I made him.
23702,"Homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. If I show up with a ""toy"" from the ""store,"" like we would give ""our kids,"" then I've failed! And these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!"
23703,T-Rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.
23704,I thought it made blimp tires!
23705,Are we still on for midnight bike riding?
23706,"Oh ohhhh boy, oh oh oh oh boy, oh boy."
23707,"O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up."
23708,He called me... a poser?
23709,You? Sticking up for your old man? You've never done that before.
23710,What? No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
23711,They can goatee... hell!
23712,"Yeah, that's right, the friendship between the Simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over!"
23713,Fine. Keep 'em. But you have to give back... Lisa?!
23714,Could we at least agree to both hate Flanders?
23715,Shut up with your names!
23716,"Parenting? Let me tell you ""cool parents"" something. Parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! It's nature's way!"
23717,"Even Flanders agrees! This is our neighborhood. We were here first, so you should leave."
23718,"Oh no, it's true!"
23719,"Stupid town... at least I've still got Moe's... although probably not, seeing where this is going..."
23720,What happened here?
23721,"Oh, Marge, it's bad."
23722,I brought these people to Springfield... and now they've taken over!
23723,It's a hellhole!
23724,What happened to our town? Everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future!
23725,"Okay, you win. We don't have to be friends, but can we live on the fringes of your world? Like those eels that eat whale poop?"
23726,"Your organic, all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all!"
23727,They're necessary! They're necessary!
23728,They're finally necessary!
23729,I did it! I did it! I man-hugged!
23730,"Well, I can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt."
23731,Oh no! I won't be able to help you pack up Grampa!
23732,Hold down the fort?! With my bad back?!
23733,"Man, that keyboard playing cat is so cute."
23734,Villageville. Build your own authentic medieval village. I must have something better to do.
23735,And ca-lick!
23736,"Finally, a woodcutter that will do what I tell him."
23737,Holy moley! He's already made a clearing! Let's go for a glade!
23738,Just call me DeForest Kelley. I gotta write that down and send it to Conan.
23739,Move this here. Tap. Mill! Mill! Barn! Silo! Tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern-tavern! Brothel. Parsonage! Theater In The Round! And... hay pile...
23740,"And the Lord saw what he had made, and it was good."
23741,"That's right, your Lord sticks his hand in his pants. And yes, it is the same hand I tapped you with."
23742,"Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore."
23743,You're back!
23744,It's real to them!
23745,I don't know -- the back yard?
23746,Oh my God. I forgot to feed my jackass!
23747,You're hel-come!
23748,"Oh, right."
23749,A lot of good backups. How pregnant is the raccoon?
23750,"Good, Marge. Get their price down."
23751,Not a crier.
23752,Goofing on it made me feel wise!
23753,"Prep, prep, prep..."
23754,I believe the word is idiote.
23755,I know what must have happened:
23756,I'm gonna get a snack. But first... should I introduce the black plague? What could be the harm?
23757,"Whoa, now I've gotta buy a corpse wagon. That's how they getcha."
23758,It's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.
23759,"Oh yeah, baby, I'm drinking you down to your knees."
23760,GONNA DRINK AMMONIA / 'CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE CHEESE / WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN...
23761,"A minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! Torture, torture, torture!"
23762,He knows I love him. And he loves me.
23763,"That's short for ""Rrright you are!"""
23764,How are they his treats if I paid for them?
23765,"Okay, okay. I'll be nicer to the dude. I've just never really been a dog person."
23766,Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!
23767,Ever!
23768,He's still my dog!
23769,"I don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!"
23770,It doesn't make sense to me!
23771,I happen to remember it just a little differently.
23772,"Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say..."
23773,Everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!
23774,Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--
23775,"And then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the Santa part."
23776,"Wait. Wait. There's one part of the story even Grampa didn't know about: a few months later, I went to rescue Bongo..."
23777,"But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for..."
23778,Bongo was happy. Without me. He had become her dog.
23779,"Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made."
23780,He still has my sweatshirt.
23781,"Oh my God, Dad... I owe you an apology. You saved Bongo. I never understood that till now."
23782,"Why would you think that, just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?"
23783,"Okay, but I'm a little out of practice."
23784,What flavor?
23785,"If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers."
23786,My dog.
23787,"Yeah, Mom, you promised!"
23788,"Sorry, Mrs. Simpson."
23789,Is this a kid you'd pay ransom for?
23790,Feed it to the dog.
23791,Don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!
23792,Can't I keep an eye on that kid? He's fabulous.
23793,It's always my kids.
23794,Where'd they go?
23795,Almost... holy moley...
23796,"What the--? Ooh, it's hopeless."
23797,Who the hell are you?
23798,Absolutely not! My adult frame is simply too large. No! Never! Fine! Here I come!
23799,Crawling... so painful...
23800,...duck walk... infinitely worse...
23801,"Sh, sh. Shhhhh. Soon you'll know peace."
23802,"I made it, kids! I am king of Learning-ton Castle!"
23803,Real matuuure!
23804,What cool kid thing's in here?
23805,Never!
23806,Butter.
23807,"Apes... deep down we're all savage apes. Leave your body, Homer."
23808,What the hell was that?
23809,"Well, I've taken eight months off. It's time to get back on the horse."
23810,"I guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show."
23811,America can't collapse! We're as powerful as ancient Rome!
23812,Sweet.
23813,"Oh my God! This unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!"
23814,"Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys! Always partying on deck with your Docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!"
23815,It's based on nothing!
23816,"I'd slash my wrists! But how, without my electric knife?!"
23817,I can't conceive of any.
23818,Don't worry. I am very good at keeping secrets.
23819,Impending doom...
23820,"Honey, everything's fine. There's nothing to worry about."
23821,Just go play your saxophone while you can.
23822,Secrets? I have no secrets! Just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of. Smell some bread!
23823,Typical sheeple.
23824,Maybe.
23825,"Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself, and I'll have gained six pounds. What's that about?"
23826,I guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
23827,"I wish. Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies."
23828,"So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?"
23829,"Hollywood has taught you well, my son. Now let's push ""play."""
23830,Fridge-ra-torr!
23831,Do not question the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.
23832,Wow. Your end of the world is better than my during the world.
23833,"Aw. Uh, listen, I've gotta know. You're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?"
23834,It's okay. I know what I am.
23835,Um... a lot of that stuff must've got lost in the move.
23836,I want to tell you but I promised to keep it a secret.
23837,It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
23838,I've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.
23839,See? These are our bug-out bags. In here is everything we need to survive.
23840,The looming kablooey.
23841,"Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon."
23842,There's no handle on this side!
23843,The one thing I couldn't prepare for.
23844,"Marge, this is it! TEOTWAWKI!"
23845,"Uh-huh, where's the kids?"
23846,"Boy, get in the car. And say goodbye to your best friend forever."
23847,This is my daughter. She brings the gift of music to the new world.
23848,Baritone.
23849,Here's something to pass the endless time. Write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.
23850,Society will not have to start from square one.
23851,"Marge, when I started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me."
23852,"Well, just because I imagined it doesn't make it any less true. And now all those people are on their own."
23853,If Jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.
23854,Why do we have to shoot them at all?
23855,No! I want to help the people who didn't prepare!
23856,"Don't be silly, ""Mary Ellen."""
23857,"Now we're going to leave this place. I'm sorry, Bart -- I know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend..."
23858,White rice or brown?
23859,So we'll take these supplies back to Springfield where they're needed most.
23860,Hm. I cut the wires to something.
23861,"Okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. If we miss it, we're dead."
23862,How can that be? I took every last can of gas!
23863,"Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall."
23864,"Out of our way, corn! The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets."
23865,"Now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy, starvation, and having sex for procreation."
23866,"You got to watch a VHS copy of ""Red Dawn"" thirteen times. Stop complaining."
23867,"We can keep the shrimp de-veiner though, right?"
23868,"Good riddance. When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest."
23869,"Goodbye, my electrical friends. I can't afford to use you, so I'm doing what any good American would do -- throw you away."
23870,Parking meter?!
23871,And it still works!
23872,"This could come in handy. But let me check that list of things Marge said never to bring home. Dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses..."
23873,"Parking meter, you're workin' for me now."
23874,Lotta people at the dump today.
23875,"This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!"
23876,It's not that kind!
23877,"All right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot."
23878,"Oh God, my back! Suckers! My discs are grinding! Easy money!"
23879,"We're cool, right boy?"
23880,Now to sleep the sleep of the just.
23881,I'm king of the bus station!
23882,"Eat silver, copper!"
23883,"Stay with me, man. Stay with me."
23884,"No, no! You're the first successful business I've ever run!"
23885,"The pillows are safe at my workstation. As for the quarters... well, I'm ashamed to tell you what I did."
23886,How long have you been in there?
23887,Woo hoo!
23888,...and I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana ... that the Isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... I wish that wishing wells worked so I wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that Marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things I do ...
23889,"Way to get us back on topic, Marge."
23890,You live like this?
23891,"Dear Lord, if thy tornado must take me, please let it take me to Oz, but don't let Flanders be the Scarecrow!"
23892,"We made it, boy!"
23893,Oh my God. Oh my God. This counts as a walk!
23894,The tornado took old what's-his-name! I'm going after him!
23895,"Lenny, take us with you to find our dog! It's okay, Marge, they're professionals."
23896,Hey!
23897,Maybe the last words I'll ever write.
23898,"Maybe! Look, you guys obviously know about weather, but I understand something much more predictable: women."
23899,What women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.
23900,That is the stupidest...
23901,I would never do that.
23902,Fine. But I swear: I will win you back from Lenny.
23903,"Help me, God! What is it I'm paying you for every Sunday?"
23904,Can always use... a good babysitter.
23905,He was a black guy but his voice sounded like a white guy.
23906,"Yes, it won't give!"
23907,Found another one.
23908,"Were you worried about me, boy?"
23909,Clearly the boy's in shock.
23910,Stop being blasé!
23911,"Now I know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. Just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes."
23912,Connecticut?
23913,"Okay, you're right. It's hard to imagine anyone else bringing up our kids, but I think the choice is obvious -- my dad."
23914,Good point. We'll find somebody else.
23915,"I got it, Dad."
23916,"Oh yeah? The tornado was more of a father to me than you! Okay, how about my brother? He's rich."
23917,"Oh, how very kind of you. I am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! One lump, please."
23918,That's some impressive flute-nastics.
23919,Goodbye forever!
23920,"All right, Marge. Maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. We'll take what we can get."
23921,"Kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your Mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family."
23922,This is not that! And that smart-alecky attitude is exactly why no one wants you!
23923,"Okay, I'll nudge 'em with the car. We'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going."
23924,Wait! What about that couple? They look pretty cozy.
23925,"Wowww. Your house is perfect. No sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool Grampa..."
23926,"Ooh, Thanks, Dad."
23927,"Wow. I assumed The Jackson Five were the only perfect family, but now I see there's another."
23928,"Uh, say, listen, Portia. How would you and Mav feel about... um, swinging?"
23929,"No, no, no. I meant pushing kids on swings."
23930,"Okay, take whatever time you need. I just want to know if you'd like to be their guardians."
23931,"Man, you sure can talk surfer talk."
23932,Maybe this'll help you make up your mind.
23933,You never know when you might wanna mail something.
23934,Worrywart Marge. You don't look a Trojan Horse in the mouth.
23935,"I swear to you, Marge, when I have the time, I will Google them both."
23936,"Oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but I'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what I'm saying..."
23937,Great. And now my Dad can notarize.
23938,Name another.
23939,Now I can finally complete my bucket list.
23940,"Too late! You already signed! Oh wait, there's one more."
23941,"Suckers!!! Oh wait, you've gotta initial this."
23942,Check mate.
23943,"Hey, if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend."
23944,"Marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit."
23945,It helps me write.
23946,"Marge, this has been great couples time. The one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!"
23947,I don't like the way they just rip the paper off. Santa's Little Helper my ass.
23948,No one steals my kids... except me... from that theme park jail... that I never told you about... except I guess I just did... we're all caught up now... let's go!
23949,"Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young."
23950,"Oh yeah, man."
23951,"Don't worry, Marge. We'll get 'em. Unless we die on this icy mountain road. Then they've won forever."
23952,Women and their horrible thoughts.
23953,"Marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. But those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. And now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them."
23954,"I've got a bone to pick with you! Then, an apology to make. Then, we exchange insurance information. Then, more bone picking!"
23955,Those better be good breaks.
23956,"Sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?"
23957,"Well, I'm glad someone has."
23958,We've won. Woo hoo.
23959,"Instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living."
23960,Why you little...
23961,I do call this living! Living the way kids in India can only dream of!
23962,I win!
23963,I forget.
23964,"Ladies, please! You can boss me around, just one at a time!"
23965,What the?
23966,Finally! A supervisor!
23967,Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.
23968,"If you're lucky, me, then this."
23969,"Listen to your sister, boy."
23970,What are you talkin' about? Marge and I are goin' great.
23971,It was during Happy Hour. Don't you want our baby to be happy?
23972,How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.
23973,Why you little... I'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!
23974,You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!
23975,I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
23976,"Finally, we're gettin' somewhere."
23977,"Hand me my suitcase, boy."
23978,When you're older.
23979,"You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?"
23980,"I've told you a thousand times, call me Homer!"
23981,Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
23982,"Oh, it'll happen again, son."
23983,Knock yourself out.
23984,Not again!
23985,I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.
23986,Shows how much she... knooooows! It's hurting my eyes!
23987,"You know what we need? A classic ""kicked outta the house"" party. Now who's got a rockin' CD?"
23988,"That's it? Well, then let's ""power"" this party up!"
23989,This calls for decisive action -- like L.B.J.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the Civil Rights Act.
23990,"The same way Hollywood does, by watching British movies!"
23991,"Agreed, but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture."
23992,After we finish watching the movie.
23993,I WROTE THIS SONG TO SAY I'M SORRY
23994,THE MELODY IS BY BEETHOVEN
23995,MARGE YOU WILL GET THE LAST PORK CHOP...
23996,And I promise to do the things I checked off within a year.
23997,I think it's a Terence Malick movie.
23998,"Finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles."
23999,"Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets."
24000,I'm on it.
24001,"If I buy you, why do I need all these books?"
24002,Spot the Hidden Objects.
24003,"Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met."
24004,"Gotcha! Candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book... okay, let's see..."
24005,"If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."""
24006,"Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world."
24007,Got 'em!
24008,"Sure, what do I care?"
24009,"Whatever you say, sir."
24010,Sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.
24011,Grownups have their reasons!
24012,But I just did that!
24013,"Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights Magazine?"
24014,Where does it say that?
24015,"Highlights... ""for..."""
24016,Leave it to me...
24017,Earring!
24018,...thimble from Monopoly game...
24019,...twenty-five dollar casino chip...
24020,...the smallest nesting doll!
24021,Just my honey pie.
24022,Wanna split it while we snuggle?
24023,Licking the wrapper.
24024,Waldo. Waldo. Waldo.
24025,We'll get those kids back.
24026,Because we just bought them new shoes!
24027,Waldo. Waldo.
24028,How many kids will jazz corrupt?
24029,No. I'm sorry. It's... wait a minute.
24030,We've found what we're looking for.
24031,"Sure, they could be here. Who knows?"
24032,Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret!
24033,There's always a catch.
24034,"It's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me."
24035,"Son, promise you will never look like me."
24036,Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
24037,I can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on TV.
24038,"Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUI's. The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs."
24039,Ooo! Jail music!
24040,I'll give it one marathon.
24041,"No one feels out a unit like CJ! Not Bubba, not Debbie and Danny, no one!"
24042,"High-five me, Marge!"
24043,Too late!
24044,We're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful! And dead people.
24045,"There's other P.O.s? Uh-oh, better put on my game shades."
24046,One thousand dollars!
24047,"In the money game, cash is king."
24048,You won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.
24049,Feather boas?
24050,Tights? Robes? This stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.
24051,Why would my man-dad have lady stuff?
24052,Beefcake mags?
24053,That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.
24054,Those are pretty cute...
24055,"My dad's always been so angry. Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy."
24056,"Yeah. Gay rights are human rights, baby."
24057,"It's okay, Dad. We know the truth, and we love you."
24058,"Just admit who you are, and you can find new love."
24059,No fatties!
24060,Fine.
24061,"If I can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then I've failed as a son."
24062,Then how do you explain this?
24063,Who?
24064,Look at all this wrestling stuff.
24065,What's wrong?
24066,"You were a world-famous wrestler? Spill the beans, old man. Word beans!"
24067,Those things?
24068,I don't know. Should I really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?
24069,Text me the choices.
24070,"Apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. Just like you and me. Swear to God."
24071,Fine.
24072,"Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!"
24073,No I don't. If you pray to Superman.
24074,"Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?"
24075,"You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"
24076,It's found footage!
24077,How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!
24078,"Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!"
24079,Why does everything I forbid always happen?
24080,"He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe!"
24081,I wish Grampa was my dad.
24082,Hey Flanders. Can I borrow some sugar?
24083,A little cream?
24084,"Now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, I'll be on my way."
24085,Are your kids gonna be there?
24086,Okay.
24087,"Hello, police? I'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress."
24088,This room just got a whole lot cooler.
24089,Look at the size of that bird! I'd go Henry the Eighth on those drumsticks.
24090,"Yeah, it's medicinal. We had a pain in our neck."
24091,I didn't know you were left-handed.
24092,But the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.
24093,What about Christian Archie comics?
24094,"Here, I'll get you started. Hail Superman, wearing tights, Clark Kent be thy name... one nation, under Zod..."
24095,"Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge."
24096,Your famous murmur. You know .
24097,"Thanks, Flanders. Punch my eye, destroy my marriage. Now just pull the plug and let me die."
24098,"I hate unions. There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job."
24099,"Oh yeah. I say ""union"" you say ""power""! Union..."
24100,Union!
24101,"Marge, you're really dogging it on the ""power."" But don't worry, because of the union, you're safe. So, just what are you gonna do for our daughter?"
24102,We really appreciate that.
24103,Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.
24104,"Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!"
24105,Just what do you want?!
24106,"So, you went and hired a law firm, eh? That's pretty aggressive."
24107,"C'mon, man. What's the catch?"
24108,Hmm...
24109,"I'm not punching you, Flanders."
24110,"Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels."
24111,"It's not for me to judge, Ned because... I am the better man!"
24112,"Better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!"
24113,"You may be the sweater man, but Homer is the better man."
24114,I didn't know you were left-handed.
24115,"Fear not, people. I will lead you safely across."
24116,"Help me, Flanders!"
24117,"What's wrong, Sweetie?"
24118,Even after we came to school?
24119,Every time I try to fix things it just makes things worse. But I'm gonna fix this!
24120,I think I have an idea.
24121,"Flanders, I've come to forgive you."
24122,"But, there is one condition..."
24123,Don't wanna hit you. I want your wife.
24124,"To elaborate, I want your wife, the teacher, to help get rid of Lisa's substitute..."
24125,"How much plutonium do you want? Gotta warn you, it might take me twenty minutes to get it."
24126,This is praying?! Let me outta here!
24127,Help me God!
24128,I don't like the sound of that funeral march.
24129,"Okay! I'll pay for your damn band candy! What was it, seventeen hundred dollars?"
24130,Now do me wearing a sombrero!
24131,Now have me sleeping under a cactus!
24132,All too well.
24133,"Son, if there's one thing I've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! It's so frickin' boring! Run, boy! I'll create a distraction!"
24134,You gotta be kiddin'.
24135,It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.
24136,"Keep it under your hat, guys, but I've got a date with a married woman."
24137,Her husband's gonna be there too.
24138,Give up? It's Marge -- I'm having a lunch date with my wife.
24139,Date with my wife.
24140,When we got married I promised you a life full of romance. Now here it is.
24141,"Marge, this is amazing. I never realized some restaurants are better than others."
24142,Oh yeah.
24143,Beats drowning.
24144,What? What? You're interesting. Why would you say that?
24145,"Words hurt, you know."
24146,"Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally, the Kissing Walrus."
24147,Uh-oh.
24148,"Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous."
24149,"Conversation, conversation... you look great."
24150,"And uh, how was your day?"
24151,"You can't spell ""lousy"" without ""us."""
24152,"Marge, wait!"
24153,"Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other."
24154,"Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch."
24155,"Oh my God! A marriage so perfect that I could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. What do I do?! What do I do?!"
24156,I like that picture of the sneaker with wings. I'm gonna flee!
24157,Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?
24158,Fleeing didn't work. I have no choice. I will have to... do whatever the other thing was!!!
24159,"I'm fightin' for ya, babe. Fighting like I would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box. And to show you how serious I am..."
24160,From the place beside the gas station!
24161,Marge was so happy when I made those promises. What changed?
24162,"How do I win Marge over? I could get her kids to like me! No, that ship has sailed."
24163,Hm. Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?
24164,I think it would!
24165,Searchy? Where can I find brake fluid?
24166,That was yesterday.
24167,Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?
24168,I can't please any woman.
24169,"Okay, let's see how straight it is."
24170,What have I told you about comical entrances?
24171,"I'm planing down that door that always sticks. I put training wheels on Bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline."
24172,"Yes, my love?"
24173,"Oh. Well, you know how in the Special Olympics they give medals just for showing up?"
24174,"I'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision I have to make."
24175,You're all I have left. I trust you completely.
24176,Okay... this should do it.
24177,Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
24178,Omakase? Where have I heard that word before?
24179,Wow. Wow. This is the most delicious analogy I've ever eaten. I need to share this insight with Marge. Put this in your finest Styrofoam!
24180,"Once again, by eating alone I have saved my marriage."
24181,"For reasons I forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage. But what I know for sure, is that I want to share it with you."
24182,"Well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy."
24183,"Moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"
24184,Woo hoo! I'll woo her with woo-hoo!
24185,Hello dere!
24186,The minister's wife? What are you here for?
24187,"Listen pal, this may sound kinda kinky, but I would like to, uh, please my wife."
24188,"I think I could give it a shot what-what, guvnah. Bob's your uncle."
24189,Oh Marge! Come to the ga-rage! You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a sing-song fash-ion!
24190,Just relax. Sit down. Not in that chair! It has no bottom!
24191,Anger's a mood!
24192,I don't know. It's just that you always say we should try new things. But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...
24193,Quick! Call the Procter and Gamble help line!
24194,What does that mean?
24195,It's behind the Dingle Swing.
24196,"So, you forgive me?"
24197,"Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?"
24198,Which one?
24199,What size batteries.
24200,Ooh! How many?
24201,Holy moly!
24202,Really? You wanna throw something out just because it's a little old?
24203,No need. I already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.
24204,"And you know, Marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends."
24205,They charged a deposit!
24206,"That's right, sweetie. It always comes from corporate."
24207,Ew! Just hearing about them makes me itch.
24208,"Funny how the brain does that, huh?"
24209,The brain is so stupid.
24210,"Probably one of Bart's dirty friends! Boy, why are your friends so dirty?"
24211,Touché.
24212,Wait a minute! This has oats in it!
24213,"Ooh, a nose-hair trimmer!"
24214,"Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't."
24215,"And if it's such a ""Good Book,"" how come there's no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris? And he'll flack anything!"
24216,"Seriously, ""Pews?"""
24217,Deacon? Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?
24218,"Oh, now we're talkin'. But why me?"
24219,"Well I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the snow plow business, ""I'm your astronaut""!"
24220,Just looking for the bathroom.
24221,But this paper towel feels so good.
24222,That would save us several hundred bucks.
24223,"Right, um, I don't understand, Lisa, we let you get up early to watch the Royal Wedding!"
24224,Since when?
24225,"It's an honor, sir."
24226,Lost sheep! Yes! Sis boom bah!
24227,Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. The answer may shock you.
24228,"Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. I never hated the church itself. And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself."
24229,Why you little...! lamb... mustn't... kill own son... only God can do that...
24230,Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Church--
24231,Someone finally took one!
24232,DAY BY DAY... DAY BY DAY... THE DEACON'S JOB... IS PRETTY OKAY... PRETTY OKAAAY... I'M GOING TO BE A DEACON... DAY BY DAY... I'M ALREADY A DEACON... DAY BY DAY...
24233,"Son, I'd love to, but... I'm a deacon now. My butt's place is in my pants."
24234,What the--?
24235,"Calm yourselves! In times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in... Reverend Hooper."
24236,His boringness saved us all...
24237,Compliments of the deacon!
24238,DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY / I'VE GOT THREE KIDS / AND TWO ARE OKAY / TWO ARE OKAY! / ONE OF THEM IS THE BABY / THE SMART ONE IS MINE MAYBE / I HOPE THE BOY GETS RABIES / DAY BY DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY... / OH I PRAY / DAY BY DAY BY DAY BY DAAAY!
24239,Oh boy.
24240,Is that the radon detector?
24241,"Marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine Oscar Red Carpet! There were some awesome dresses! And quite a few dis-as-ters."
24242,"Well, I can't part with a single one of my ""Hoarders""! Hands off my episodes of ""Episodes,"" and if you delete ""Revenge""..."
24243,...so I stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.
24244,Nothin's gonna delete these!
24245,I know C.P.R.
24246,I took a class where you do chest compressions to a Bee Gees song.
24247,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE... HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE...
24248,Too on the nose. I REALLY NEED TO LEARN / 'CAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF FOOLS...
24249,Now wait a minute. Gotta make sure you're okay. Who's the president now?
24250,He's back!
24251,The woman I love!
24252,"Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident."
24253,"Okay, Moe, one more surprise."
24254,"They're like a wedding ring, I can't take them off anymore."
24255,Got anything for a man my size?
24256,"Tent, eh?"
24257,"No tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. Thank you, fashion police."
24258,Thank God I'm not in the shower!
24259,The crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.
24260,Stupid clog...
24261,My head hairs! I'm bald!
24262,Get-- Get get in there...
24263,Woo hoo!
24264,"Aw, dammit!"
24265,Is it that obvious?
24266,My wife has never seen my head naked. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.
24267,"Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe."
24268,"Those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. Average schmoe like me, forget it."
24269,Sausage fingers!
24270,"Okay guys, here's the deal -- I've gone bald."
24271,What are you talking about?
24272,"The way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not."
24273,It's not even noon.
24274,Who are you?
24275,"Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay."
24276,You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.
24277,"Wow, is that what your wife did?"
24278,Which one?
24279,"Yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true."
24280,"Marge, I have something to show you."
24281,"No, it's something else."
24282,Well?
24283,"Hair, no hair, I don't really think about it."
24284,Tell me about it.
24285,"Oh Marge, when you hold me like that..."
24286,To me it's legs versus boobs.
24287,What the--? Change the channel? But I'm watching soft-core tennis!
24288,What the hell is that?
24289,Did she really say that?
24290,No.
24291,"You like this now? What about ""Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?"""
24292,"You did it, baby. You promised no fun and you delivered."
24293,"Guys, this science exhibit that told me how stupid it is to play the lottery."
24294,Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.
24295,Four lucky numbers for four best friends.
24296,"And I'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. No one knows why."
24297,I'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings!
24298,To the best feeling in the world -- money.
24299,"Guys, I got big plans for these winnings. I'm going to build... a swimming pool."
24300,"So freaking far in the ground, baby."
24301,"Yeah, that's probably what happened."
24302,I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
24303,I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.
24304,"The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl."
24305,Our money's gone.
24306,"Guys, I think we might need a new song. FOUR BEST FRIENDS WHO NE-VER QUAR-REL"
24307,I don't think so -- his travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal...
24308,"Hey, what's this? ""I've gone home. Goodbye forever, Carl Carlson."""
24309,"I know, me too. It's the ultimate screw-over."
24310,"Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff."
24311,Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!
24312,I just need to get closer.
24313,He's looking at a geyser! And there's a sign in front of it!
24314,It's too small to read.
24315,I thought it was Superman's Superman-cave.
24316,Fifty bucks per bag? I guess I'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.
24317,Baby... I'm going for us. That money is gonna dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.
24318,I've already taken care of that.
24319,"This is funny, it says here Iceland is green, and Greenland is icy. The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody."
24320,"Just say he's black, Moe."
24321,How do you know about Carl's family?
24322,"All right, this is it, Carl's family home. Twenty-two..."
24323,"Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters."
24324,The gates are locked.
24325,"Aw, dammit, we lost him!"
24326,It's no use. We're perfectly matched.
24327,We did it!
24328,"Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine."
24329,"Sorry, Lenny."
24330,What the hell is this?
24331,"Sorry, Carl. It's World War II all over again -- America kicks Iceland's ass."
24332,"Guys, do you think Carl was right? What if we're not real friends? Maybe we are just lonely guys who do... guy stuff..."
24333,Put the noodles in the shed. There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.
24334,Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.
24335,"Well, we won't know that till after."
24336,But how can we learn to read ancient Icelandic?
24337,Yes!
24338,Forvitinn.
24339,You can't not do it!
24340,"Okay, let's see what this thing says."
24341,"""When the barbarian invaders came, the Carlsons met them with their weapons ready""..."
24342,"...""weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders."
24343,"The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."""
24344,Carl's family was even worse than people thought.
24345,Yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.
24346,Attention everyone in Iceland! We have an important announcement!
24347,Is this everyone?
24348,"I've learned something about the people of Iceland. You've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister."
24349,"You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn."
24350,But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson...
24351,It doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago. For Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.
24352,"And when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him. Carl Carlson leaves them in the fridge."
24353,"Aww... thanks, Flanders. Gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much."
24354,We don't get together to share our emotions. We get together to escape them.
24355,"Okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new..."
24356,...keg-pools!
24357,"Fine, I'm going home."
24358,"And we're more in love than ever. In your face, people who said it wouldn't last a year!"
24359,Better clean that off.
24360,"You have a great day, ma'am."
24361,He's not your daddy.
24362,I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.
24363,"But first, m'lady, let me escort you to Heaven -- the fancy Swiss chocolate store on level three!"
24364,"Just call me Borders Books, 'cause I'll always be here."
24365,"Yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. And I promise each anniversary will be better and better..."
24366,But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
24367,"Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that..."
24368,Why are you taking away the train?
24369,"Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. Sir, I need this train!"
24370,She won't see it like this. I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.
24371,You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
24372,"Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night."
24373,"Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?"
24374,"Shake it off kids, they're just jealous!"
24375,There's no such place!
24376,Uh... anniversary? That comin' up?
24377,"Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. ""Laser."" That's a funny word. It's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
24378,The surprise is safe! The expression on her face will be priceless!
24379,Currently: zero.
24380,"Don't worry, Moe. When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back."
24381,"Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?"
24382,"Thinking is your department, jerk! That's what I pay you in beer for!"
24383,What? Where're your going? I--
24384,"Um, Marge, I have to go."
24385,What train?
24386,All worth it for Marge!
24387,I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD...
24388,Because it's in the public domain?
24389,"Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!"
24390,"All right, all right, I'll be right there!"
24391,"Boy, oh boy!"
24392,"Marge, I threw my back out. Can you please refill this prescription right away?"
24393,It's in Drugtown. Not the nice part.
24394,"And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse."""
24395,"It's working. She's gone! All right, everyone, magically appear!"
24396,"Wow, Moe. Great shrub costume."
24397,"You guys are the best. I just want you to know when I'm holding Marge in my arms tonight, I'll be thinking of all of you."
24398,You think we'll last twenty-five years?
24399,Hall and Oates? What's going on here?!
24400,Costume drama or naughty comedy?
24401,"You just dodged a bullet, Mister Sugarpants."
24402,"My only secrets are my marathon time isn't four twenty-six, it's never; I often go online to see how Lindsay Wagner's looking now - fabulous; and I once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something. But it's no secret how much I love my Margie."
24403,Honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?
24404,"Oh baby, that's all I needed to hear."
24405,How did we get here?
24406,BUT WHEN MARGE WENT BOO HOO / I WAS BUILDING A CHOO-CHOO...
24407,YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET...
24408,"Okay. I'm ready for the Nuclear Workers Convention! It's a little sad. The guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick."
24409,"Even better, I never unpacked from the time we went to Hawaii."
24410,"Ooh, my lava's almost cooled!"
24411,A whole weekend away from my family. I can't believe I have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. Send me a picture?
24412,"Now look guys, we are here for one important reason: to get free swag."
24413,SWAG! I'M GONNA GRAB FOREVER / STUFF THAT I REALLY DON'T NEED / SWAG!
24414,I'M GONNA HAVE FORTY KEY CHAINS! / AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE FORTY KEYS! / SWAG!
24415,"MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF..."
24416,"MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF, MORE FREE STUFF..."
24417,I still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!
24418,"I'll kill you, you son of a--"
24419,To texting!
24420,"Hello, everyone."
24421,"I overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight."
24422,All the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. I had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.
24423,"Yes, back to normal."
24424,"They're called ""Superoos,"" son. With pictures of the cast of ""The Expendables""."
24425,That kind of small scale violence solves nothing.
24426,"Uh, I'll pass on the pork."
24427,"I'll just enjoy these green beans with slivered almonds. Mmm, so slivered."
24428,A napkin.
24429,Can I just get a glass of water?
24430,"Marge, I changed in Boise. I'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed."
24431,You're so beautiful when I cut you off in the middle of a question.
24432,Moving my body.
24433,How y'all doin'?
24434,"If you are a cat, prove it. Do you hate Mondays like Garfield?"
24435,And do you love lasagna... like me?
24436,Okay then.
24437,"Hanging up the receiver, eh?"
24438,How much did you say?
24439,So I heard half of nothing.
24440,Lisa. I'll miss you when this is all over.
24441,This conversation.
24442,See you on the other side.
24443,Of the house. Where the fireplace is. We're toasting marshmallows. Marshmallows.
24444,Okay.
24445,What was the first one again?
24446,"Hey, I'm the one in bed with two beautiful women."
24447,In a breaking and entering kind of way.
24448,"Let's just say I've got to get to work on time. And if you knew me, you'd know just how odd that sounds."
24449,No one.
24450,HEERE'S THE CLIMAX
24451,WHAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN BUILDING TOOOO /
24452,HOPE IT PAYS OFF FOR YOUUU...
24453,Weird thing under a tarp.
24454,You laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
24455,How'd you get in here?
24456,I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.
24457,"Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa."
24458,"I missed my flight so I got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. They wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, I had the ass."
24459,They taught me something I found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. This t-shirt lied to me!
24460,And they also gave me an alcohol detox.
24461,I've been listening to this song for three days and it's only the end of the first verse!
24462,"Lisa, I've never prayed to a city in my life, and if I did, it would be Hershey, Pennsylvania. I was kneeling on the Affirmation Rug they gave me."
24463,See?
24464,"Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
24465,"Lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where I work poisons our water and our air."
24466,"Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in."
24467,"Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken."
24468,Both sold to me by Apu this morning.
24469,"When I release it into the A. C. system, it'll stink up the plant forever."
24470,Just like when I smell up the toilet.
24471,"Hey, hey, it's not what you think, Lou. Lou! Lou! Lou! Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!"
24472,We sure did.
24473,"No, I was just up late watching a movie. Something with... William Holden and--"
24474,A beer from the sky! It's a sign!
24475,Shut up.
24476,Why you little... I'll teach you to make medical history!
24477,Oops.
24478,All good.
24479,"Hey boy, since you don't need a bedroom any more, I finally get my man cave."
24480,Man cave! Everyone's welcome to my man cave!
24481,"Great... oh, and I have this ""two heads for one"" coupon."
24482,How 'bout this one?
24483,One random disorder free with every schizophrenia.
24484,Should've chopped off Bart's head long ago.
24485,"Ooh, mix-ins!"
24486,Son-of-a!
24487,THIS IS THE SONG THAT YOU HEAR AT THE CIRCUS / SUNG BY A GUY THAT YOU SEE AT THE CIRCUS...
24488,"Marge! Get away from those freaks! You belong to me! The dumb, hairless brute!"
24489,Taste the strength of your fiancé!
24490,"Marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus."
24491,With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?
24492,"I'm an idiot! Of course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her, and the ring is mine. And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!"
24493,You're gonna be sorry you said that.
24494,"Hey Marge, you wanna marry Moe?"
24495,The poor lonely fellow is about to die.
24496,"Let me worry about how. But you know, you could make his last day a happy one. And the ring is just the icing on the cake."
24497,The ring that'll get me outta this lousy circus and into a good circus. Now let's get you married.
24498,"But won't you be jealous, my love?"
24499,"Dear, I am not the jealous type. And from you, I have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos."
24500,Ho ho ho! A very small time!
24501,"Those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover. Now, the toast..."
24502,"To you, Marge. Now you are one of us."
24503,One of us! Gooble goo!
24504,"Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
24505,"Strong man, Moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster. Leave my trailer forever!"
24506,"You're rejecting me? But I'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties."
24507,What the hell does gooble goo mean?
24508,"You killed Burnsum? Now who is gonna say ""Step right up""?"
24509,This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!
24510,"...and that, kids, is how I met your mother."
24511,People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.
24512,GET DOWN / EVERYBODY'S GONNA LEAVE THEIR SEAT
24513,"Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever."
24514,Overstay my welcome for forty years?
24515,I'm thinking about it!
24516,That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.
24517,"Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball. You heard me. Technology is a fad. Heavy blue balls are the future."
24518,You cost me a piece of all of that!
24519,"Aw, don't cry."
24520,I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
24521,You misheard that on purpose!
24522,"Um... it says I should give you ""lumbar support."" Better go to the lumberyard..."
24523,"Hey book, are you expecting this?"
24524,And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
24525,That is a good fire.
24526,We've had some good times.
24527,And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice.
24528,What the?
24529,I think I just might have what you're looking for.
24530,Today I'm glad that I sold that stock.
24531,Why does everyone know?!
24532,My boy's okay!
24533,And together we are.
24534,"I'll handle this. ""Dear Weirdo, pick up weirdo kid."" And send."
24535,What the?! If this kid's Dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.
24536,"Once again, cats have it better."
24537,"Look at me, I'm afraid of dying!"
24538,"NO DREAM WILL COME TRUE,"
24539,YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.
24540,I'm tired of livin' once.
24541,"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past."
24542,My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.
24543,"Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. We'd write each other with our dreams of the future..."
24544,I was gonna be King of Cheeseburger Mountain. Did I change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? Probably a little bit of both.
24545,So sad.
24546,"If you're my wife's secret lover, come in. There's nothing I can do for her anymore."
24547,Eduardo?! Is it really you? why are you here?
24548,I'm Homer Simpson!
24549,I wish.
24550,"Buenos dias, Eduardo. Can you write back and tell me what that means?"
24551,"What happened to us, Eduardo? We had so many things we were going to do."
24552,"Yeah, well listen, pal. I have my treasure: my wife and my children."
24553,Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
24554,"Did you just fart, sir."
24555,Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming. I wanted to see who would get here first.
24556,Why are you doing this? Wait. Are you in love with me?
24557,Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty!
24558,One more ride?
24559,"I don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but I feel great."
24560,That doesn't sound happy.
24561,"Mmm, melon collie."
24562,"Well, what was your childhood dream?"
24563,Let's do it.
24564,We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed!
24565,Eduardo. I haven't felt this good in years. You're like the Tooth Fairy except you don't collect human bones.
24566,"So that's it? All my dreams, lived?"
24567,"Well, we've gotta do it! I never leave a job unfinished. It's as true now as that week I worked on the high school yearbook. So much infighting. I had to get outta there!"
24568,The editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.
24569,"Um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided Rocky's voice, June Foray. A true legend in the voiceover community. I'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence."
24570,Okay.
24571,I'm doing it! I'm flying like the squirrel I always knew I was.
24572,"Ooh, indigo!"
24573,"Majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness."
24574,So beautiful.
24575,"Aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half."
24576,Stupid tallest building in Springfield!
24577,"Son, it was so beautiful! I went faster than the speed of sound."
24578,"No matter what, Homer Simpson has done it. And soon I hope I remember who Homer Simpson is and his relationship to me. But I have no regrets. In fact, all this has given me a sense of calm I've never had before."
24579,Can you give me the morphine forever?
24580,Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!
24581,Oh. It was all just a dream.
24582,Oh yeah. Great. Um... Do I drop you at the curb or do I have to park and walk you in?
24583,"No time for breakfast, Marge. Just give me a banana."
24584,"Now, listen... I have to work late tonight."
24585,It's a tough economy. Money doesn't grow on trees.
24586,It grows on threes!
24587,"Nice sunglasses, Lenny."
24588,"I'd better call it a night, guys. I don't want to take any more of your money."
24589,"Who's president now, Alexander Hamilton?"
24590,"Timing the elevators, eh? Smart."
24591,"Okay, okay, no worries."
24592,What the?
24593,Everyone has a cellphone. Mine's at home.
24594,"Everything will be fine... um... Oh you, uh, you like movies? This reminds me of that scene in ""Alien."""
24595,The scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.
24596,"Oh, he was just here."
24597,You like lies? Here's a few: college is expensive but it's worth it...
24598,"Okay Homer, remember your Lamaze training..."
24599,"Yeah, wow, that does feel good. Oh no, I think it's coming. I haven't even picked a name yet!"
24600,"No, I didn't!"
24601,"Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--"
24602,"Oh! Oh wait, there's more!"
24603,"It's a dude! And he's uncut! Very Euro! Now, hug your mommy."
24604,"For unto you is born this day, in this elevator, inspected in August 2009, a baby."
24605,"Yeah, that guy didn't even look over once."
24606,Miraculous.
24607,Mothers are so awesome.
24608,"Good game, everyone. I never dreamed a night where you'd discovered I was cheating and beat the crap outta me could end on such an up note."
24609,"Hey, Gretchen!"
24610,Good as new. And thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. It may be a little stretched out.
24611,"Wow. So now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m."
24612,"Aw, that's sweet."
24613,"Um, hey... I was just driving by... with some baby stuff we didn't need and uh...here's some diapers Maggie's too big for, an incredible educational toy I forgot to give Bart..."
24614,"Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight..."
24615,I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
24616,Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju?!
24617,Where's Hoju? Where's Hojuuu?!
24618,Kids blow up so fast.
24619,"Oh, no, I'm shopping for Homer Junior, a baby I delivered in an elevator the night I pretended to go to work but was really playing poker!"
24620,"Oh, yes, I am shopping for Maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent."
24621,"Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
24622,"Um, November."
24623,Excuse me.
24624,Oh baby!
24625,"Oh baby, shake it! Homer like!"
24626,"Shake it! Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you."
24627,Tell me what a cow says!
24628,My other baby mama!
24629,"Marge, it's not what you think!"
24630,"Oh, it's cool. We did it in an elevator."
24631,"But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good."
24632,I haven't had a drink for a week.
24633,It's true. Even the other guy in the elevator. He's right here.
24634,"Goodbye, Homer Junior. I guess you're the man of the house now. And never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first you can usually wait till the seventeenth."
24635,Exactly. You always said charity begins at home -- but not which home.
24636,And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
24637,"SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP SLEEP / SLEEP, SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP!"
24638,"Oh man, I really overdid it tonight."
24639,"No. I'm exhausted from ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. Knees and toes."" It's the ""toes"" that get ya, Marge. It's the toes..."
24640,"Way ahead of you, Marge. I am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow."
24641,Yes. We'll be back by three. Homer has a very tight nap schedule.
24642,I was talking about myself in the third person.
24643,"I wanted you all to be happy together, so I brought you to the zoo where all the animals live in harmony."
24644,"Hey, oh oh oh! Now Maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family."
24645,"Why you little... I'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! C'mere, you!"
24646,Can I just say goodbye to him quick?
24647,"Okay, I know what'll cheer you kids up. Seeing me out-monkey the monkeys."
24648,I have a soul and you guys don't!
24649,Look! Shiny keys! Jingle jangle!
24650,Stupid monkeys.
24651,"I'm sorry, Homer Junior. You'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill."
24652,"Okay, I've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. The sky is blue, but no one really knows why. Don't believe what they tell you. Girls are great and terrible at the same time. Get used to it. And, most importantly-- Oops, we're here. You'll have to figure it out on your own."
24653,"Sorry, little fella. One day I'll be that guy who comes to your wedding, makes you feel a little weird, and then runs away."
24654,Woo hoo! Who's Chase?
24655,You didn't tell me he was a soldier.
24656,"Um, he likes it if you tickle his toes."
24657,But n-n-n-nurture...
24658,"I guess this is it, little guy."
24659,The most beautiful words a father can hear.
24660,Oh.
24661,I do.
24662,"Hi Maggie, if you could talk, I know you'd have a few choice words for me."
24663,You want me to take care of your dolly?
24664,That's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.
24665,"Hey, what's this marching band have to do with Homer Junior? What? There were cheerleaders in our house? And nobody told me?"
24666,"Ooh, spaghetti."
24667,"Y'ello! Lisa, you got a call from someone named Isabel."
24668,"May I ask what this is regarding? Oooh, a budding new friendship? Oooh! Boy, how come you can't get a new friend?"
24669,"All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!"
24670,"Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle."
24671,Fine. You're Mike Singletary. Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
24672,MY NAME IS HOMER / I'M A REAL FULL BACK / GONNA RUN THAT BALL / DON'T WANT NO FLACK...
24673,Why you little--
24674,You used to be fun.
24675,That's our girl.
24676,What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.
24677,What your mother is trying to say is--
24678,"Get real, ding dong! You've already done so much bad stuff, Skinner's never going to let you on that boat."
24679,"Marge, I love Bart as much as you do but actually not. And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble. Now if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's."
24680,Ooh! Thank you.
24681,What the?
24682,Come on.
24683,"Hello, boy. At times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened..."
24684,"Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway."
24685,"As I always say, don't get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner."
24686,Yes. What's Skinner's weakness?
24687,Good. We can use that.
24688,"Wait a minute... I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner. But you beat your rug till it bleeds?"
24689,"Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently."
24690,Let me handle things. Just go upstairs and shut the door. There are some things only a boy should see.
24691,"Just call me ""The Cleaner."""
24692,The deed is done.
24693,"Look, you kill them, I get rid of them. That's always been our deal. But I do have one question: do you want the head?"
24694,Well if you change your mind it'll be in my freezer. But only for a week. Got a lot of ice cream comin' in.
24695,"Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life. You'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. So avoid mirrors."
24696,"Sorry, but Dick Fiddler is allergic to potatoes."
24697,Someday I may have to fake my own death. And maybe you can help me with that.
24698,"Someday soon. As in, what are you doing this Friday?"
24699,Dick Fiddler!
24700,"You know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful."
24701,"Marge, to that I say boo, humbug."
24702,"Global Warming, huh? By pure coincidence, every scientist was right!"
24703,Snow?! Snow!!!
24704,"Oh, you know what this means, kids?"
24705,I don't have to pick up the dog poops!
24706,"Oh good. Marge remarried after I died. Wait a minute, I'm not dead. What's goin' on?"
24707,Uh-uh! No way! I'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! And maybe that guy. Lincoln-style. But that's it.
24708,"Oh, I don't know. It won't seem like Christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in January."
24709,"What the-- ""The Simpson Bed and Breakfast?"" I always wanted to stay in a place like this!"
24710,But Christmas is a special time. And I like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.
24711,"Well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior I want to encourage in you. I'm in. A hundred percent!"
24712,I'm on a break.
24713,Fine. I'll drink alone.
24714,The secret is don't read the comment cards.
24715,I thought they were just gonna watch me.
24716,"Ho, ho, ho!"
24717,The pillow acted as a girdle.
24718,You got me weed?
24719,"That's great, sweetie. After all that time and hard work, I'll have... radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! Radishes. Nothing but radishes."
24720,What? I'm saving them from the struggle of life.
24721,Vegetables?!
24722,"Shut up, Flanders!"
24723,"Oh right, we're still doing that."
24724,"Come on, I'll drive you to the airport."
24725,"Where are my keys? Oh, right here."
24726,"Oh, boy. Monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend."
24727,"Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?"
24728,Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet!
24729,But what if I want some cooled water?
24730,"They're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad. I'll do that thing you like."
24731,AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
24732,"Okay, I've gotta go see the Radioactive Man movie before it gets totally ruined for me."
24733,"If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!"
24734,Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets!
24735,"Bye bye, money!"
24736,"Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free."
24737,"More snip, less lip."
24738,"All right, movie, you better be worth it."
24739,The motorcycle dudes are chicks!
24740,I wonder what else is chicks?
24741,"Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!"
24742,You're shushing me! This guy's on his cell phone! She's texting! He's sexting! And that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!
24743,"What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!"
24744,Illegally download it? Is that legal?
24745,"Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--"
24746,"Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?"
24747,"Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie! Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. Number nine--"
24748,Shut up shut up shut up!
24749,Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?
24750,"Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!"
24751,And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
24752,"Welcome to ""Cinema Pirate-diso."" Tonight's movie is ""Life is Funny,"" directed by Judd Apatow. It's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"
24753,"I live it, he writes it."
24754,"Well, what'd you think?"
24755,"Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
24756,Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?
24757,"I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""Cosmic Wars Episode Seven""."
24758,"Ooo, mastermind."
24759,One of you turned me in? Who was it?
24760,You!
24761,"Superintendent Chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same Hawaiian shirt to that luau!"
24762,"Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!"
24763,It's probably someone I would never suspect! Never suspect!
24764,Your moans of sympathy are all I have!
24765,Whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!
24766,Forever!
24767,What are you guys in for?
24768,Movie piracy.
24769,Woo hoo!
24770,"I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!"
24771,"Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""Taken"" where the ""Hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""Fast and Furious."""
24772,Consulate.
24773,"Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital."
24774,Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. You're the greatest wife in the world.
24775,You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!
24776,"Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?"
24777,Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.
24778,All I ever had was you looking out for me. I've got nothin' now.
24779,No.
24780,"You know what, Judge Apatow... I do have something to say. These movie people may say I'm a pirate. But I'm just a man. A man who loved Hollywood too much. So I made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life."
24781,At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
24782,"But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in."
24783,"One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost."
24784,I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.
24785,What the hell is all this?!
24786,You're pirating my movie?
24787,The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths.
24788,"Oh that's Hollywood fantasy. We live in the real world, where I have something called ""prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion""."
24789,Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees!
24790,And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.
24791,Homer in the movie wears Ask Body Spray and so should you. Don't ask! Do smell!
24792,Up bup bup bup bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?
24793,What?
24794,"And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy."
24795,Yes I have! After the Oscars when he forces you!
24796,"C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife."
24797,Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.
24798,"Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back."
24799,And now to Moe's.
24800,Bart! Your comic vendor's here!
24801,I will help you. As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.
24802,But why pick me?
24803,Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!
24804,Honki da yo?!
24805,"Not garbage, Americana."
24806,"We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone."
24807,Not a word.
24808,"You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei!"
24809,"I know, Mr. Sparkle."
24810,I get that a lot too.
24811,"Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old."
24812,I didn't tell you about the basement.
24813,"No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?"
24814,Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice?
24815,Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine?
24816,What's going on here?
24817,Why you slimy little...!?
24818,As long as we keep drinking this.
24819,GLOWING RODS / GLOWING RODS / IT'S MAKING ME / WEAK AND DIZZY...
24820,Who told you that?
24821,I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.
24822,Glasses! Call Lenny!
24823,"Lenny! It's me, Homer!"
24824,Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?
24825,I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
24826,Look at these jerks.
24827,"I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are ""Funny Or Die"". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."
24828,"Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!"
24829,Woo-hoo!
24830,"Springfield City Hall was built for the Spencer Tracy movie ""Meet Me At City Hall"". It was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for thirty years..."
24831,The rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
24832,"As early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up..."
24833,"Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford."
24834,"That's it, I'm taking you off."
24835,Reality!
24836,"Okay, let's see what we've got here."
24837,"Squeeze here. Rotate there. Pause for sweet talk. Oh glasses, you're so wonderful."
24838,Where's my money?
24839,But the avatar looks just like you!
24840,"Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. Under five dollars."
24841,"Glasses, take me two minutes back in time."
24842,Marge...
24843,About the glasses...
24844,"I'm really sorry, and..."
24845,Only five pancakes? You're trying to kill me!
24846,"Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?"
24847,"Anyway, I'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them."
24848,"Hey, everybody!"
24849,"Carl, it's me! I'm here! Really here!"
24850,Ow!
24851,Stop!
24852,Wait!
24853,What! No one can live in a non-augmented reality! I need another pair of glasses!
24854,"Um, Mr. Burns, sir? Can I get another pair of glasses? Maybe two pair. One for the beach house. Can I also get a beach house? Two beach houses..."
24855,Monitors?!
24856,What the-- Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!
24857,This is a violation of our human rights.
24858,"Okay, so let's see what we can see!"
24859,"Solitaire, top hats on eBay, Angry Birds fan fiction...guy doing really easy crossword puzzle...Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup."
24860,...someone's actually working...
24861,Maggie?!
24862,"Awww... Wait a minute... since Marge is wearing my glasses, I can see everything she sees. Uh-uh, I shouldn't watch this."
24863,Wait a minute. Marge said we were out of ice cream.
24864,What else is Marge hiding from me?
24865,Is she having an affair?
24866,Why isn't she having an affair?
24867,Mr. Burns!
24868,"Marge, that's a compact-only space!"
24869,"Well, who knew you were such a rebel? Now, let's learn more about my wife's secret life. Secrets which can only be good."
24870,Marge is in therapy?
24871,Pale ales. Please.
24872,Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!
24873,"Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"
24874,"Spied on her with a hidden camera. She thinks I'm selfish, she thinks I don't spend enough time with the kids..."
24875,I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.
24876,"Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?"
24877,"Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?"
24878,"Uh, I'm here to check in for the three o'clock."
24879,"That's ""Fake Name."""
24880,"That's ""Alias."" Du-uh."
24881,Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.
24882,No need. Everything's fine.
24883,"Well, as long as I'm paying for the time..."
24884,"Ow! Where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?"
24885,"I don't need to know, Marge. You deserve to have your secrets."
24886,"Okay, Marge. But first, well, I have something I need to tell you. Something I did you might be mad about, and rightly so."
24887,Woo-hoo! I tried! Okay.
24888,Yeah. And?
24889,Where's that cake now?
24890,Who bought it?
24891,Excuse me. I have to make a call.
24892,"Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged."
24893,"Wait, something's wrong. That's better."
24894,"Sorry son, I only have twenties. And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well."
24895,"All right, son... but you have to pay me back."
24896,Do you have my money?
24897,Do you have my money?
24898,"Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?"
24899,"Seriously, do you have my money?"
24900,Where's my money?
24901,Where's... my... mon... ey?
24902,"Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here. Do you have the money?"
24903,"Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge."
24904,Quit pressuring me!
24905,What? Did you owe me some money?
24906,"Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep."
24907,Ten minute rule.
24908,Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!
24909,"I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
24910,"Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler."
24911,"More like ""at your six-pack,"" am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap."
24912,Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
24913,But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
24914,It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.
24915,What's he doing?
24916,"Okay. In your terms, points are like mice."
24917,Don't interrupt! I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.
24918,Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
24919,"Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that."
24920,I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!
24921,At least someone in this family is using them.
24922,"Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler."
24923,Because it's his home forever.
24924,"I'm eating the food of the future. Beep, boop. What is... love? Boop, beep, boop."
24925,"Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?"
24926,Go! Go! Go!
24927,Real doctor or PhD?
24928,Sideshow Bob!
24929,Overfed? I don't know this word.
24930,Fine. I'll take you. They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.
24931,It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.
24932,That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
24933,I like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.
24934,"Marge, teens can't control their urges. It's why there's never been a teenage President."
24935,"No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given."
24936,Sorry.
24937,"Listen, you punks. If you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place."
24938,What the--
24939,Never!
24940,How dare you torture my children with Mozart!
24941,I call all music Mozart!
24942,"If it's not final, who cares?"
24943,"If it's important, they'll call back."
24944,That man can't remember anything except our number!
24945,"My contract clearly promised ""barely livable""!"
24946,"Oh... I guess Grampa's coming home with us. Unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."""
24947,"You're right. Bad idea, bad idea... Should we just, y'know... drive by and take a look at the place? Bad idea, bad."
24948,"Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father and I love him. But three octogenocerouses?"
24949,Speak for yourself. Glug-glug-glug. Chomp-chomp-chomp. Beeeeep. My lifestyle is my retirement plan.
24950,"Uh... c'mon, boy. Your job is to guide me."
24951,"I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!"
24952,"You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--"
24953,"I've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags. They pee all night, they cry all day and every time they use the computer the font is huge!"
24954,Have you seen how he treats my Grampa? Never visits him. Never even acknowledges his existence.
24955,Oh yeah!
24956,"Okay. You know, I love him too. In a manly way that never shows itself."
24957,"I can handle them from now on, Marge."
24958,"Gentlemen, I've been thinking. My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. Someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old."
24959,I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.
24960,"Wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before."
24961,"Oh, when does the exercise start?"
24962,Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!
24963,"Uh, okay! Um... I can't."
24964,"All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge."
24965,Better turn up the heat.
24966,"Young lady, in my day..."
24967,You won't feel so bolloxed once my social security checks start coming.
24968,Falsies.
24969,Oh my God! I know that kid! We've gotta help him!
24970,Fine. Your generation did its part when it won World War Two and created the Rockford Files. I've got this one.
24971,"Oh, it is so hard running in sand."
24972,No. No. I can't be old yet. I won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till I'm fifty-two!
24973,I'm coming at you with all the power of a reverse mortgage!
24974,"Now let's go home, son."
24975,We've got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.
24976,"Lisa ""wants"" ""a"" ""dot dot dot""..."
24977,Guinea pig?
24978,"Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you."
24979,Emojis. Now she's gone too far.
24980,"Circle ""other."""
24981,"Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate... we can skip all this litter box stuff... if pet becomes internet superstar, all rights revert to father... Sign here, here, initial here, one more over here, and... done."
24982,"The kid-parent contract -- unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave."
24983,"You don't have children, do you?"
24984,"She's gone, honey. She's gone."
24985,She thinks she's decided. Don't say a thing. Don't blow this!
24986,Fighting Tweakers rule!
24987,Kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
24988,Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...
24989,"Yeah, these seem great. Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin."
24990,I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
24991,You know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.
24992,"Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks."
24993,You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.
24994,"Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus."
24995,"Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!"
24996,"No, you'll wear it out!"
24997,"Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right."
24998,"Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
24999,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
25000,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
25001,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
25002,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
25003,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?"
25004,"Yes, they sold it to us. So now it's our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep."
25005,This dude gets it.
25006,I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!
25007,"Are they, Marge? If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?"
25008,"I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake."
25009,Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
25010,"Marge, you like kindness, right?"
25011,"So even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti."
25012,Homer looks into Marge's eyes.
25013,It's kinder never to tell them.
25014,What'll it take to buy your silence?
25015,"Okay Milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together."
25016,I guess. You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you.
25017,We had a deal. And now we've got nothing...
25018,"We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!"
25019,That's exactly how it is.
25020,Oh it is.
25021,"Oh, that was cold, Luann. So cold! BRRRRR! SARCASTIC BRRRRRR!"
25022,"Honey, there's something I wanna show you."
25023,"I don't know whose this is. I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it. Look at the balance."
25024,"With that painting we could have what these people have. A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter."
25025,That's the cushion.
25026,Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.
25027,"""You have no obligation to share the money from that painting."" Ooo, a support rock!"
25028,Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.
25029,"The paddles, Marge! Look at the paddles!"
25030,Our cushion!
25031,"Excuse me, we're trying to find ""Café Artiste."""
25032,I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.
25033,"What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?"
25034,"So, why does that chick think she owns the painting?"
25035,"Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want."
25036,"Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find Café Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours."
25037,But our cushion...
25038,I wish I knew how.
25039,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting."
25040,That's why she'll believe it.
25041,"Sounds delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here."
25042,And that man sold it to me!
25043,That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
25044,I love art!
25045,Who?
25046,Prove it.
25047,Oh... crap.
25048,Then why did the auction house say it was real?
25049,Now let's play human foosball!
25050,"What if I never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?"
25051,"Oh, great. The painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. And when Marge finds out she's gonna kill me."
25052,While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
25053,I'll pay you in Strupo...
25054,Rockin'
25055,"Marge, it happened again!"
25056,Loser.
25057,Pathetic.
25058,He makes me sick.
25059,"The trick is, wait several weeks."
25060,I'm so glad I was forced to come.
25061,'CAUSE I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / LISA NEVER LIES / I'M A GRADE SCHOOL HERO / AND HEROES NEVER DIE / JUST ONE GUITAR! SLUNG WAY DOWN LOW / YEAH ONE GUITAR! / WHERE DID MY LAWNMOWER GO?!
25062,"Lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me."
25063,When did you come up with the idea? You must've worked on it for days.
25064,There's sausage being made? Where?
25065,Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.
25066,Ooh!
25067,Oh yeah. That's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.
25068,"Of course I am, but how do you know?"
25069,Much better.
25070,"Well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. Except at my profession."
25071,"What do you think, sweetie?"
25072,The two thousand eight Super Bowl?
25073,It's okay. I'm an American!
25074,"Sure, why not?"
25075,"""Congratulations on your purchase of a FootMaster brand soccer ball."" Thanks, book!"
25076,I believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one D would disagree with you.
25077,What the?!
25078,"Look at you, using approved electronic devices."
25079,"Here you go, honey."
25080,The stomach wants what it wants. I need some air.
25081,"Ah, Brazil. I couldn't stay afraid of you forever. The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. That is a deal breaker."
25082,Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
25083,You don't know the new me of the last few days at all!
25084,Red card!
25085,Get outta here!
25086,How fresh?
25087,Where's your mother?
25088,"Give the donuts to the hotel staff. Release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild."
25089,Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
25090,Why so quiet?
25091,I'm listening. And it better be devastating.
25092,"Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy."
25093,To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
25094,Fine. Marge is always complaining I never fix things. Give me another.
25095,I carry my own.
25096,"If I bet it, I could double it. But on who?"
25097,Thanks for telling me. I was gonna tape it.
25098,Wave a Brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.
25099,You're a funny one to tell me about deception.
25100,"Well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness."
25101,It was pity-fridged!
25102,"Oh, come here."
25103,Everything's right with the world.
25104,"That's all right, brain. If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed."
25105,No penalty!
25106,"I repeat, no penalty!"
25107,No penalty!
25108,"Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants."
25109,No penalty.
25110,I've never seen anything so beautiful.
25111,"Hey-hey, what--"
25112,Cleats.
25113,Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.
25114,"Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's..."
25115,"Once intoxicated, we had a great idea."
25116,Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!
25117,Best recess ever!
25118,Help me guys! Guys?
25119,"Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?"
25120,But I did learn something from all this. The sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.
25121,"Oh, are the kids with you?"
25122,"Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?"
25123,Don't worry. It's bottom all right.
25124,Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater?
25125,"Yes I did! I heard ""competitive eater""!"
25126,Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!
25127,I will when you open your mind to change!
25128,Eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? It's all about the money with those firemen.
25129,She can smash a salad.
25130,What the?
25131,"Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine."
25132,Wait. Let me get this straight. Sit and eat? That's my punishment?
25133,"Oh, I can fake attentive. I've been watching a football game this whole discussion."
25134,"Okay, okay. We'll make it fun. I'll take her to that crab place. All the crabs you could smash."
25135,She might marry someone like me? You think that would be bad!?
25136,"Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!"
25137,I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight. Ours is crap.
25138,"...so Marge says I gotta ""ask Lisa on a date."""
25139,Feels weird.
25140,"Oh, It's ringing!"
25141,"Uh, Hello. Lisa. I know your brother and..."
25142,"Stupid, stupid, stupid!"
25143,"Uh, yeah. Hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and I should have dinner together, sometime..."
25144,"Yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb--"
25145,Woo-hoo! I got a date with my daughter!
25146,"Hello, Marjorie."
25147,"Yes, well it's a special evening. And I thought it best not to look like a monkey."
25148,"Don't worry. I won't embarrass you. I will put my napkin in my lap. I will use the utensils provided for me. And if our food is slow in coming I will ""blow my stack"" in a manner befitting the Earl of Yarborough."
25149,"Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa will get stuck with someone like me."
25150,"Ooh, pepperoni!"
25151,Is there no end to your fault-finding?!
25152,"Maggie, help me with this shirt."
25153,"Nope. Now, how's that drink? Can I Temple up that Shirley?"
25154,"Uh, yeah, help me out here. What is the ""normal amount"" of entrees per person?"
25155,I mean for adults!
25156,No. I mean for adult males.
25157,"All right, I'll have the lasagna."
25158,"Oh, uh. Vegetarian. Can the red sauce be cow blood?"
25159,"Marge please, control your jealousy. This is your daughter!"
25160,"Um. Excuse me, Lisa."
25161,A friend from high school.
25162,"I'm sorry, that's all very nice. But I can't forget what you said."
25163,Where'd you get that dress?
25164,Wow. Wow. That looks just like the dress you wore on Project Runway.
25165,"Oh, right. I mean, this looks like a dress from a local Springfield store. All is forgiven. Let's have dinner."
25166,"Thanks, Frenchy."
25167,"Oh, how much did I eat?!"
25168,Pfft! I'm as healthy as a horse.
25169,"Marge is right. I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now."
25170,Legs pumping! Blood flowing!
25171,Two at a time! Heart exploding.
25172,All that's left are clever last words.
25173,I'm number two!
25174,Somebody kill me.
25175,"Amen, baby! Did you make potato salad for the wake?"
25176,I'm back! Comin' through!
25177,"Yeah, I can die all I want -- Frink's got Homers like the Tuileries has park benches. Huh? Wonder where I picked that up."
25178,Two weeks?
25179,Wait a minute!
25180,Yo. Where's my body?
25181,"Bonk! Bonk! Bonk! Ooh, corner! Ba-donk!"
25182,"Hey kids, wanna chase Grandpa Homer around the house?"
25183,"It's not exactly fun and games for me either, Marge."
25184,"Oooh, ""Goody Gobble""!"
25185,"Woo-hoo, liquid center power-up!"
25186,"Uh, Marge? 'Scuse me. Uh, I think I need a reboot."
25187,Just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for fifteen minutes...
25188,"No, no, no! Don't pull me out before you click eject! That hurts like a mother--"
25189,"Son, can you put me in 3-D for a second?"
25190,Why you little! I'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness!
25191,'Bout time!
25192,Hey! Where's my junk?
25193,Whew!
25194,Sure.
25195,Body. To Moe's.
25196,"Open your stance a little, there. Yeah, that's it. Do your worst, kids!"
25197,"Come on! Hug your Grampa, boys!"
25198,Threat perceived. Terminate! Terminate!
25199,Kids are so afraid of being terminated.
25200,"Lookin' good, Santa's Little Hybrid."
25201,I think that's about to change.
25202,"Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade."
25203,Whoa. That's a bit of a woo-hoo. Indeed.
25204,Sit down.
25205,"Well, better get home. The delightfulness ended hours ago."
25206,"Why are you doing this to me, booze? I drank every kind of you!"
25207,"Have a good day, you two! Don't be me!"
25208,"Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?"
25209,"Oh, everyone does, son. That's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit."
25210,"Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that."
25211,Yeah... well just talk about sports!
25212,Flanders! Can we borrow your spatula?!
25213,And you never bought a replacement?
25214,Why you little! I'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers!
25215,"What is your problem, boy?"
25216,"Wow. I've gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts."
25217,Eat the nuts! They're your dinner!
25218,"Thanks, Moe, I... huh. Must've left my wallet at home."
25219,Fat Tony?
25220,Hey!
25221,"Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop."
25222,"Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it."
25223,Anything else?
25224,How is it my fault?
25225,LET THEM RUCK THE NIGHT AWAY!
25226,I just did that because it was a series of funny words!
25227,"Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse."
25228,"Come on, buddy. Just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here."
25229,"Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls."
25230,Not like that. It's like this. ...Smithers ... ...Mr. Largo... ...Danny Kaye... What? Everyone knows.
25231,Now where's she going?
25232,"Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right!"
25233,That horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.
25234,Ew. That tastes horrible!
25235,Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.
25236,"You know, pregnant is pregnant..."
25237,"We're not lost, boy. Not by a longshot. We just have to set the mood."
25238,"LET THEM PLAY! WE WON'T LOOK, WE'LL TURN AWAY / GO MAKE LOVE, THEN EAT SOME HAY..."
25239,BE THAT AS IT MAY
25240,FAT TONY'S HORSE IS GAY!
25241,ROLL IN HAY!
25242,I DON'T CARE ABOUT TOMORROW / WE NEED TRUE HORSE LOVE TODAY
25243,HERE'S A BLANKET THEY CAN BORROW
25244,"Ah, young love."
25245,You monster! My knees will be in my throat!
25246,Teach him not to pee during parades. He'll get more work.
25247,Ooh! Can I lick the ceiling?
25248,Fine.
25249,"Ooh, doubles!"
25250,"Because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four."
25251,"Okay, sweetie, I'll call the Van Houtens."
25252,But...
25253,They all make good points.
25254,Oh. Thank you. Why was that on the Military History Channel?
25255,Can I check out what toys they have?
25256,Dinner party at the neighbors'. At least I can drink.
25257,"Walking distance, Marge. I've been looking forward to this all week!"
25258,"You know, I have more cheeks."
25259,They'll get their blood money.
25260,Question. It says here the murderer is Admiral Wainsworth. Who's that?
25261,"Well, you know--"
25262,Why you--
25263,"Well, as we say in Russia: ""Goodbye in Russian""!"
25264,"Uh, nice night for a walk."
25265,Do you want to be more alone?
25266,More?
25267,What the?
25268,"Okay, I slept on the couch, and I flipped the sweaty cushions over. What else can I do?"
25269,Mmmm--
25270,"Because... Oh. Oh, okay, okay. What should we do?"
25271,I see.
25272,Woo-hoo!
25273,"Well, if that's how you think it has to be."
25274,It might be easier with Maggie. She's always getting letters from the Daycare center.
25275,So... where are all the friends?
25276,Who are you?
25277,"Well, Lisa's going to be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is Gus Frickin' Huebner!"
25278,Yeah. Nothin-- Nothing's going on.
25279,Lots of pizza.
25280,"See, Marge. Problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone."
25281,You gave away ice cream?!
25282,"Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent."
25283,"I'm sorry she rejected your ""I'm Sorry,"" cake, but in a way, I'm not. I guess what I'm trying to say is I like cake."
25284,Is that the boy you named me after?
25285,You pay Lenny and Carl to be my friends?
25286,"Dad, is that story really true?"
25287,Crap!
25288,"Don't worry, Marge. As a favor to you, I'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp."
25289,Needs more numerators.
25290,"Ah, July fourth-- No fireworks?! Can't this stupid city entertain me one night a year?"
25291,"Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. God bless her."
25292,"Marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, I will. I've mapped it out."
25293,I've had my problems with sparklers.
25294,"Now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are."
25295,Kaboom.
25296,"Giuseppe, I want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career."
25297,"If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten."
25298,Woo hoo!
25299,Okay. Let's make some fireworks.
25300,Oh thank God. A rickety bridge.
25301,Can I pitch something?
25302,My boy's having a bad night. We should get the show on the road.
25303,Come on. Let's go. I can't stand to see my family unhappy on America's holiest day.
25304,"Hey, Super Mario. Don't you tell me about America!"
25305,"No, you're a-wrong!"
25306,Who the hell is that?!
25307,SOMETIMES WHEN WE TOUCH
25308,"One more year, tops."
25309,"Then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!"
25310,"Believe me, if you're holding a three-hundred-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem."
25311,It's a song? I thought we were just riffing.
25312,I don't!
25313,Usher! Will you stop that person who's shushing?!
25314,Out of my reach? Must... make... effort...
25315,What's on TV?
25316,Why you little! I'll show you who's a Flabbi!
25317,All muscle. In Minnesota I'd be a supermodel!
25318,"Yes, son. We can."
25319,Huh? Oh.
25320,"Yeah, yeah, great. I guess my getting-up days are over."
25321,"Lisa, what are you doing?"
25322,But...
25323,"Oh Lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. Why I could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. That's why I never plan more than four seconds ahead."
25324,"Now come on, give Daddy a hug."
25325,Bubble wrap!
25326,"Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!"
25327,Me neither.
25328,Brief nudityyy!
25329,I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.
25330,I told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!
25331,I know how cereal works. Now clean your room.
25332,I'm in charge. You do what I say.
25333,That better not mean what it means when I say it.
25334,We're not similar. I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! Love it!
25335,You poor woman. Dealing with Bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. You rest. I'll be the boy's father now.
25336,Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli.
25337,You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And I'm going to sit right here until you do.
25338,Eat your broccoli.
25339,Eat your broccoli.
25340,Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
25341,Jebus loves Tebow.
25342,"Marge, I want you, my wife, to draft my fantasy football team."
25343,I can get another job! Who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? I could be a prison warden or a southern anything.
25344,"Uh, works for me."
25345,You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!
25346,Come on. Lick it!
25347,"C'mon, lick it!"
25348,You can still lick it!
25349,I don't know. Eat your broccoli.
25350,We're on an old-time boat!
25351,Relation Ship. It works two ways. Pretty good. Pret-ty good.
25352,I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.
25353,"Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. You're enjoying this, aren't you?"
25354,You're my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat!
25355,Betrayed by my worst enemy. I never would have seen it coming.
25356,I finally got over my sea sickness.
25357,I hate the Golden Age of Sail.
25358,"Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean."
25359,"Ooo! Swab, swab, swab--"
25360,What the?
25361,Fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster!
25362,"I love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name."
25363,Yeah...
25364,Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
25365,I'm dropping the anchor!
25366,You've never done what I say! Ever!
25367,"Awaiting your orders, Mr. Midshipman!"
25368,"Aye-aye, sir."
25369,Does this answer your question?
25370,I GOT A BAD SUNBURN AND I WAS CRAPPED ON BY A SEAGULL / I DON'T SEE ANY LIFEBOATS AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS LEGAL
25371,WAY HEAL AWAY! / WE'LL HEAL AWAY JOE!
25372,Hey! I was listenin' to that!
25373,Absolutely not.
25374,"My one weakness: the third ""really."" Come with me."
25375,Turn right here. I keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.
25376,"Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms."
25377,Okily Dokahama?!
25378,It's all gonna thaw!
25379,Don't you give up on me!
25380,And I will wait and worry!
25381,"Aw, somebody wants more crusts. Here you go, boy!"
25382,Here ya go. Have some more.
25383,"Still hungry, buddy?"
25384,Lucky.
25385,"Oh Marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. Man, if only you could do that with Bart."
25386,Familyicious.
25387,"What are you doing here, freezer stealer?"
25388,Woo hoo! Flanders isn't perfect!
25389,Yeah! And aren't!
25390,None.
25391,"Careful, Marge, that's how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut."
25392,"Well, you woke up the right man in bed."
25393,"I love you, Marjorie. And I've had my share of failures, sure. And sometimes I get pretty nervous. But thanks for talking it out with me. I think I can finally get to sleep now."
25394,Make love now?
25395,"No, no, I'd like to see the manager."
25396,"Marge, come on, let's celebrate! It's your first day!"
25397,"Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day. But don't worry. I told everyone about this place and they're all going to support you. You do have drone delivery, right? I kinda promised that."
25398,Dammit!
25399,"Don't worry, baby."
25400,"Don't worry, Marge. They can't beat us. Because we're family-run."
25401,Hillbillies!
25402,Finally! A customer!
25403,"Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet... Mother Hubbard standee."
25404,Whew!
25405,"Marge, have you ever seen pants do this?"
25406,I'm a litigious business man and I need a coffee to go.
25407,Why do these things happen to innocent victims? I was just about to become a million dollar crotch model!
25408,Please tell me I'm still beautiful!
25409,"Well, family, we should be proud. We took on corporate America and broke even."
25410,Mmm. Sandwich.
25411,What?
25412,"Keep your pants on, Marge. It's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through ""book fairs"" and ""silent auctions."" And parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits ""reply all"" to everything!"
25413,"Oh, that's fine then."
25414,"I'll say it, Marge, it's in Hell! The Inferno! Perdition! Arizona without the golf!"
25415,Nooo!
25416,Hm. That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
25417,"Yeah, I'll be sure to take a look at that."
25418,"No, boy. I want you to do it."
25419,"Bart, you went to Hell and came back a winner, like Jesus. Now come on, boy! Pull me apart like string cheese."
25420,Which one's yours?
25421,Nice.
25422,Stupid blood. Asking me for a favor.
25423,"Ooh Marge, that was fast. Yeah, that's it, baby. Grab my chest with your cold icy hands."
25424,The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!
25425,"All right, show yourselves in the name of this book!"
25426,The power of Chrysler compels you!
25427,"Hey... if you're Homer Simpson, show me your driver's license."
25428,He is me!
25429,"Why is it always me? I work twelve hours a week, you know!"
25430,"So... yeah. Things aren't perfect with the missus and me. And by the way, nice melons."
25431,I can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.
25432,Can you be more specific?
25433,"There's no reason to be jealous, it's just younger you."
25434,"Well, hello."
25435,A ghost!
25436,Don't yell at me! I'm a double widower! But I can handle all the ghosts you can float at me!
25437,"I think he gets it. See, he--"
25438,Ow! Ooh! What the? Mmm! I smell toast!
25439,Ooh... pork chops with gravy!
25440,Hey... but today's not Pork Chop Tuesday... or Gravy Thursday.
25441,Woo hoo!
25442,"Oh, I love Canadian on Canadian violence. Oh baby, this is so great! Thank you so much!"
25443,Wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. What's going on?
25444,"No, Marge... no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave!"
25445,"Hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. You know, their lungs are so teensy."
25446,"And if you trust them, I trust them too."
25447,Safety first.
25448,"Bad news, bears. Forecast calls for nothing but rain."
25449,"If you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?"
25450,Ha! I gotcha!
25451,You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.
25452,And now I banish you from paradise! I'm glad I never bothered to learn which one of you is which.
25453,I know just the place.
25454,Lisa! Motorcade!
25455,Woo-hoo!
25456,"Woo-hoo? I don't know... ""Fracking"" is one of those scary Lisa words."
25457,"Thanks, Charlie. Maybe fracking isn't so bad."
25458,"I'm not screwing you over. No, uh... I'm not screwing you over. I'm not screwing you over."
25459,Some folks will tell you that fracking's no good. But what they don't tell you is... hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.
25460,And all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.
25461,Authentic Italian food.
25462,Useless left-handed crap.
25463,Magical nonsense.
25464,Expensive toys for grownups they don't open or play with.
25465,Pornography and nachos.
25466,High-quality Spanish language programming.
25467,High-quality methamphetamines.
25468,"Laundry. Homework. Pranks. Poop, poop and poop."
25469,"Because I've never gotten a promotion before. Once I thought I had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. So judge me all you want."
25470,"Good, judge away."
25471,Everyone who signs over their mineral rights to Mr. Burns gets five thousand dollars!
25472,"Mr. Burns, we did it! Everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights."
25473,Excellent?
25474,Well... one.
25475,Oh baby...
25476,"Well, I'm no Carl when it comes to this stuff. But I ain't no Lenny neither. And I would say... no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt."
25477,Glad I could be of help...
25478,Marge? Why didn't you sign?
25479,Marge Simpson... I'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.
25480,"Oh yeah, great. Great, Marge. Great work. Thanks to you, Springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. And like all boom towns it would have lasted forever."
25481,"Was on fire. Was. I finally get a job I was good at, and now I have to give it up."
25482,"Wait, Mr. Burns! I'm here to man up -- it was all my wife's fault! Sometimes I think she and I have nothing in common."
25483,"Marge likes sushi, I like gum that squirts in your mouth. She's into romantic comedies, I like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. Yep, Marge and I see the world in totally different ways."
25484,So you don't miss that politics lady at all?
25485,Killdozers.
25486,Gravy Thursday.
25487,"You don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! You've just been brainwashed by liberal TV shows who use ""fracking"" as an easy bad guy. But it can save this country!"
25488,Wait... I finally get what you're saying. Fracking is great. But the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!
25489,"Hey, a couch is a couch."
25490,Woo hoo!
25491,What the hell was that?!
25492,"Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's."
25493,The eyes in that picture are following me.
25494,Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
25495,"We'd better send the dog down. Come on. Here's your chance to protect us, boy. Come on."
25496,Stupid dog!
25497,"We'll have to set a trap, bait. I mean, Bart."
25498,"All set. When he starts gnawing at you, I'll whack him with this broom."
25499,Don't drink my loved ones!
25500,A robot with a catchphrase!
25501,"Okay, so what are you?"
25502,Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future?
25503,Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.
25504,"Listen, I-I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion..."
25505,"Uh, look, I just wanna ask... can we be friends?"
25506,You're the only guy I know with less hair than me.
25507,"Yeah! Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?"
25508,You future guys have a word for everything... pal.
25509,My ears are burning.
25510,A boxing glove!
25511,But we bowled together.
25512,You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.
25513,What the?
25514,"I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?"
25515,"Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion..."
25516,"...and you're like ""ninety-nine cents? You bet I'd like one..."""
25517,And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are.
25518,"Marge, I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry."
25519,Start with Flanders... start with Flanders...
25520,Who is that?!
25521,We're here.
25522,My bowling buddy.
25523,Why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...
25524,Prove it. When's your birthday?
25525,Ha! February has no twenty-third!
25526,I was voted Employee of the Month as an April Fool's Day joke. Why you little... why you little...
25527,"Hey, I haven't had a drink in a thousand years."
25528,What the?
25529,"Aww, I will treasure this forever."
25530,"Good night, friend. You'll always have a special place here with us."
25531,"SIMPSONS, IN THE / FUTURE -- SPACE JOKES! / FLYING THROUGH TOWN / WHAT ARE THOSE TUBES / I WONDER WHAT / ICE CREAM'S LIKE NOW / MAYBE IT'S HOT / OR SOME NEW TEMPERATURE THEY INVENTED... That's it, we're done."
25532,You wanna talk about it?
25533,"Oh, thank you."
25534,A haircut? Let me see!
25535,I won't laugh at you. Let's see--
25536,Look at me! I'm Bart!
25537,"Marge, please don't say anything. It never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs."
25538,What camping trip?
25539,"Oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. Remember?"
25540,You're right. No one could be expected to remember something from a year ago. Certainly not me. Pass the gravy?
25541,"Hey, there's always room at Buzzard's Roost."
25542,"Excuse me, but grass is poking through."
25543,Poking through.
25544,Poking through.
25545,"Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner. The pork chops look traumatized. The mashed potatoes can't stand watch. Even the children seem upset. So trust me, I will come through for you, baby."
25546,Not you.
25547,"So, what do you say, Marge?"
25548,And I want you to believe me too. Isn't it great how much we agree?
25549,"Compared to the rest of these people, yeah."
25550,"Look, I really need a campsite. My wife is making sandwiches!"
25551,What about Mosquito Cove?
25552,Skunk Canyon?
25553,Ooh! How 'bout the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers?
25554,"Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson! 742 Evergreen Terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! And my pretty, pretty wife!"
25555,"You know, alarm code three six seven nine. Three six seven nine!"
25556,"Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip."
25557,"Once again, I've been saved from any consequences. It'll keep happening till one day I create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up. Thanks, boy."
25558,A CAMPING WE WILL GO...
25559,A PLACE THAT'S FILLED WITH SUN AND SAND / A DESERT STEAMPUNK DISNEYLAND / KEEP EXPECTATIONS LOWWW... / SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT...
25560,"Homer Simpson, I love you."
25561,Cars shaped like cupcakes!
25562,All camping is pointless. You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. I guess what I'm trying to say is: where's Maggie?
25563,"Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz. Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent."
25564,"Hey man, can I bum a tent?"
25565,Hey Marge!
25566,We got a new tent from a guy who O.D.'d!
25567,"Aw, let me get a picture of that."
25568,This place is great. Just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses!
25569,Get... in... the tent!
25570,Just like I planned.
25571,I understand. I already signed up for this place next year. I Gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.
25572,I'll take those.
25573,Beware the butterfly's sting! What the?
25574,...and that's the terrifying tale of how the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche.
25575,"Lisa, how many times have I told you to bow down to our corporate overlords?"
25576,It's like some kind of guitar central.
25577,Stig. You've got a name that's not a name.
25578,"Oh, I don't have what it takes to play guitar. I mean, I'm no Joe Walsh in the brains department."
25579,What the rock?
25580,I did a lick?
25581,Oh my god... I'm amazing.
25582,I'm not set at all.
25583,"This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I hadn't even thought about gels."
25584,MUSIC! BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!
25585,"Beautiful music, baby."
25586,Sure it is. You know I've always loved laying things down. Grooves are just the latest.
25587,"I feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players. Like what's his name from The Who. Or that guy from Led Zeppelin who wasn't Page, Plant or Bonham. Those are the only two I know for sure."
25588,"Oh yeah, and you know what's the great thing is about music? It's so easy."
25589,So easy.
25590,I don't know guys. I'm not sure I'm feeling this. The bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.
25591,I almost forgot the most important thing.
25592,"Great practice, guys. What do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?"
25593,"Oh... yeah, Apu, I'm sure you're a great singer. But the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a ""world music"" vibe. No disrespect to world music. I love world music."
25594,"That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music."
25595,"Guys, are you feeling this? Are you feeling this?"
25596,We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. We are now a cover band. And we shall be called... Covercraft. Because we play covers and this is our craft.
25597,"That was not my intent. Okay, Covercraft: hands in."
25598,Cover...
25599,"R ""O"" ""K"" ""C""."
25600,"Okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new."
25601,"Apu, what's wrong?"
25602,I still want one.
25603,"Buddy, buddy. Think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart in the middle of the night. You just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine."
25604,"Well son, I do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs I could write... down the names of and then cover. But then I remember: I'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds."
25605,Yep. It's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. Pretty unforeseen...
25606,"Guys, I really need your honesty here. At the Squidport Senior Jamboree... was I too in the pocket?"
25607,How?
25608,What kind of erotic asphyxiation?
25609,Oh...
25610,"I think I can answer for Apu. He's flattered, but the small-time success of Covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted."
25611,"Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi--"
25612,Not me. I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.
25613,I want his fame and fortune so much! Why must the Lords of Rock be so cruel?!
25614,Sammy Hagar? You're not dead.
25615,It's something you make sketches about.
25616,I'm not jealous. I'm envious. Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has. What I feel is envy.
25617,You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. We're gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.
25618,"Phil Collins-era Genesis is not as good, huh? ""No Reply at All,"" ""Land of Confusion,"" ""Throwing it All Away,"" ""Illegal Alien,"" ""I Can't Dance,"" and I'm sure I don't need to mention... ""Invisible Touch!"""
25619,What? So you can also get famous and bail on us? You're out of the band!
25620,"Oh, so you're sticking up for Yoko here? Looks like I've got another Yoko on my hands."
25621,Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band!
25622,Do I sound okay?
25623,They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
25624,"Well it's not enough anymore. When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. Look it up, it's called physics."
25625,"Oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?"
25626,I'll never have a per diem.
25627,Apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if I didn't help him get over his stage fright with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt...
25628,"Backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass."
25629,"Look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. What a sellout. Cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat..."
25630,Let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt.
25631,"I'm sorry, Apu. I thought you were living your dream life, so naturally I wanted to ruin it. But now I know things stink, so I'm okay with it."
25632,"Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?"
25633,HOPIN'! HOPIN'!
25634,"I'll be right home, honey. I've just got to lock down the reactor for the evening."
25635,Tight as a drum.
25636,Mr. Scrooge!
25637,"Headin' home, baby."
25638,Nothing's gonna stop me now.
25639,Maybe a drink will help me with my driving.
25640,I'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...
25641,"Hey, um, you gonna be okay?"
25642,Okay! Okay! I'll stay for one beer.
25643,But I promised Marge.
25644,"Okay, okay!"
25645,"Hey, what the--"
25646,I am so late!
25647,"Marge, think about what you're saying. It's Sir Isaac Newton's birthday!"
25648,"Yeah?! Well, good luck assembling all those toys without me!"
25649,The ghost of Marge Future!
25650,"Moe, what are you doing?"
25651,"Hey, pal. Can't believe you have to work Christmas Eve."
25652,Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.
25653,Gimme another one.
25654,Gimme another one.
25655,Gimme another one.
25656,Gimme another one.
25657,Gimme another one.
25658,Gimme another one.
25659,"Yeah, but doesn't the money go to schools?"
25660,"Aw, thanks for your honesty, Apu. Is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?"
25661,Wow.
25662,I don't wanna ruin the magic and I certainly
25663,Next year... this is... your job.
25664,... ...
25665,... Ooh!... ...
25666,Even the anchor store's closed.
25667,Any uplifting holiday movies?
25668,I guess I'll take the Concentration Camp one.
25669,"Well, if I've gotta spend Christmas Eve alone, at least no one will see me."
25670,"What if I left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?"
25671,Flanders? What are you doing here?
25672,"Say Flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? And don't say ""Jesus."""
25673,"Flanders, are you crying?"
25674,"Listen. Could I buy a left-handed uh... I don't know, eyelash curler?"
25675,Um. Maybe.
25676,Because Jerk-ass Homer has become Ass-jerk Homer.
25677,"You're all right, Stupid Flanders. You're all right."
25678,I made everyone happy but me. Some Christmas. Feliz Navidad.
25679,What the?
25680,The Nutcracker! Every child's favorite Christmas character! Is this a dream?
25681,"Man, you are a nutcracker. But I've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on Christmas? Well, being without them is worse. Can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?"
25682,What are you doing here?
25683,Oh my God. Is that girl really doing that?
25684,"Mmm, load-bearing wall."
25685,Woo hoo!
25686,This party's great. But all I wish is that I was drinking a beer with my kids right now.
25687,Hm?
25688,"Oh Marge, you found me! You always find me. Now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot."
25689,"Oh, well, I've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best."
25690,Thank you magical creatures of the mall.
25691,You have all taught me a Christmas message I'll never forget: the place to get drunk is at home.
25692,What the? This isn't Halloween!
25693,No.
25694,No!
25695,Okay! We're there! Finally!
25696,Damn technology!
25697,Turn it off!
25698,"Ooh, spot!"
25699,"Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked."
25700,Look! I see land!
25701,"You planted that on me, man!"
25702,"Fine. But I'm not paying for the insurance. Oh, what the hell, give me the insurance."
25703,"well, that's it. We've visited every section including Churro County, Toonton Abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? I'll tell you: fun. The kind of fun attractive families have in commercials."
25704,"I just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long."
25705,"Lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago. Let's go."
25706,Come on! Start this thing! I'm not impressed.
25707,This is so fake.
25708,Uh-oh.
25709,Prove it.
25710,What the? This isn't Halloween.
25711,That's good.
25712,"Hey, Captain Squid! If you really want to be nice to us, how 'bout some snacks?"
25713,Potato chips!
25714,Stupid kid! You ruin every trip!
25715,Let me just... there you are... like new... not a freak of nature...
25716,Look at all these knobs and buttons. They are clearly a superior race. But maybe that means they'll be nice to us.
25717,That's right. Pick the only two times in history where things got messy.
25718,Wow. This place is completely alien but everything's in English. Just like Canada.
25719,Can I turn my phone on?
25720,I say we take this bucket home!
25721,To Earth!
25722,Come on... come on... you son of a--
25723,"Yeah, you really went with the purple theme."
25724,"Wait, are you telling me we're prisoners in this cage?!"
25725,"See, Marge?"
25726,You're the doctor.
25727,Fine.
25728,This isn't a happy thing!
25729,Okay.
25730,What the?!
25731,"Well, we haven't heard from Maggie yet."
25732,What the? Pfft. Gibberish! Pure gibberish!
25733,"'Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before."
25734,"That kid's got talent, but c'mon!"
25735,"I get it, Lisa. I finally get it."
25736,I'd like rabbit. Lots of rabbit.
25737,Fondue? Welcome to a faculty dinner party in nineteen seventy-nine.
25738,Yes! This mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good. So long you stupid slobbering... what the?
25739,And away we go!
25740,"So, what do you eat, space broccoli?"
25741,Where are you taking me?
25742,Why are they dancing? Shouldn't they be making weapons?
25743,"...but perhaps Earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. Oh, and the golden age of radio."
25744,What about my family?
25745,"Sex mate? Clearly you've never been married. But it's great, I'm telling you."
25746,"Well, it is a great party."
25747,"Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting."
25748,What the?!
25749,Oh who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. I'm going back to save them.
25750,You forgot to glaze me!
25751,I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
25752,"Glaze, please."
25753,What's that?
25754,It does look delicious.
25755,Don't you people realize your queen is dying?
25756,"Captain's log, Star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. After successfully conquering the Rigelians..."
25757,I have such a big ass.
25758,"Set a course, Mr. Maggie. Anywhere but home."
25759,WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET / WISH I WAS IN FLORIDOR / NOW I WILL REPEAT / OH I'M WALKIN' DOWN A CORRIDOR / USIN' BOTH MY FEET...
25760,"We sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?"
25761,"But, wait a minute! That's my job!"
25762,That would explain a lot. But why did you do it?
25763,"No, please! All I'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!"
25764,Stressful. Do you see how loose my tie is?
25765,For the first time I actually had to do my job.
25766,"And Marge, I've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. A little sour and a little sick."
25767,They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
25768,"Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!"
25769,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?"
25770,It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.
25771,"No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?"
25772,What?! When were you gonna tell me?
25773,When?!
25774,"The circus? Hmmm, I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid."
25775,"Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion."
25776,Dammit! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke!
25777,How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?
25778,What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
25779,The early bird gets the shaft!
25780,Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.
25781,"'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?"
25782,"Oh! Finally! The business call I've been waiting for! Hello, this is--"
25783,"Come on, kids! There's nothing you'd be interested in here."
25784,"Eh, they'll grow back."
25785,Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?
25786,Fine. But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.
25787,"Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half!"
25788,Okay.
25789,"Ooh, patter!"
25790,"No, but we're having fun trying. Wait, I mean three."
25791,"Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack..."
25792,No I'm not.
25793,No I'm not.
25794,No I'm not.
25795,Yes you are.
25796,Yes you are.
25797,Yeah you are too.
25798,"I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!"
25799,Ew! Gross!
25800,Help... help me.
25801,Psych!
25802,Oops.
25803,Ask for boogers on Bart's half!
25804,"Get the ball, boy! C'mon!"
25805,"Go get it, boy!"
25806,"Go get it, boy!"
25807,"Go get it, boy!"
25808,Hey! Ow! Ow! I thought you were my best friend! Ow! Ow!
25809,"Um, Mrs. Simpson?"
25810,I'd be too nervous. Have you noticed that she's kinda hot?
25811,I'm ready to go to school.
25812,I'm not? Cool! Am I sick?
25813,"'Cause if I'm sick, I get to stay home and make s'mores. All I need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
25814,"...did I say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
25815,Can I play?
25816,I'm beat.
25817,Today was fun.
25818,Why you little--
25819,"I'll eat in bed. Not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... Oh, and TV would be on. Loud."
25820,"Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad. You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch."
25821,Yeah. Thank God that never happened.
25822,Lisa...
25823,...your Ma says I should do something with you. Need some help with your homework?
25824,Wanna see me make a muscle?
25825,"Well, that's everything I know that girls like."
25826,Okay.
25827,DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO-DOO / DOO DOO DOO D-DOO-DOO DOO-DOO-DOO D-DOO D-DOO-DOO D-DOO DOO D-DOO DOO
25828,"D-DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! Y'know, you're the closest thing I've ever had to a brother."
25829,Change back to what?
25830,Bloated corpse under the water. I'd say he's been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?
25831,Woo hoo!
25832,What do we do next? What do we do next?
25833,"Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever."
25834,- parked! I hate stack parking! Wait! Where am I? This isn't the circus! It's an amusement park! The furthest thing from a circus!
25835,"Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have tied one on at Moe's. If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?"
25836,Ooh! I've missed you too.
25837,What the? Lasagna in bed?!
25838,"Y'know, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid."
25839,The best. Wonder what ever happened to him.
25840,"You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore. I'm gonna try something new."
25841,"What do you say, boy? Wanna split the lasagna?"
25842,Why you little...?!
25843,It's good to be back.
25844,Can we cuddle for a little while?
25845,It is!
25846,"Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!"
25847,"This means war! Boy, bring my toupee!"
25848,"Go ahead, boy."
25849,"Uh, Pittsburgh thirty-five, Dallas thirty-one!"
25850,"Ha-ha! Stupid eagle! It wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! Marge! Preheat the oven!"
25851,You-- get-- out!
25852,"I've got him cornered, boy! Bag him up!"
25853,"Not so majestic in a trash bag, are ya?!"
25854,Oopsie.
25855,Seems almost a shame I'm gonna have to bang you against a wall till you die.
25856,Um...
25857,"Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. Insanely, unbelievably great!"
25858,Perfect! Just like when we let you name Maggie.
25859,Bye!
25860,"Oh my God! Brace yourselves, family. We're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours. Boy, get me my baseball bat."
25861,Die!
25862,"You're the guy who put wheels on luggage? Oh, bless you! Bless you!"
25863,"And now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg."
25864,"Mmm, raisin detra."
25865,"Hey Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow."
25866,"Great. And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me."
25867,"Fine. We'll both go. And if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""
25868,So do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?
25869,"""Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free."" It's as old as the Bible."
25870,Ditto.
25871,"Aw, man, I wish those were white meatballs."
25872,"Uh... don't tase me, bro. Chocolate rain!"
25873,What about the chocolate?
25874,Um...
25875,I gotcha!
25876,Well duh!
25877,"Suggestion for the ""suggestion box."""
25878,"Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em."
25879,"Careful, Elon. He's not as kindly as he appears."
25880,So... what kind of lunch do you pack?
25881,"Wow. Elon, you're like Willie Wonka without the underpaid munchkins."
25882,"Uh, I'd like to offer you something... but all I've got is coffee... with cream!"
25883,"Come on, I want cream! Give it up! cream and sugar are one thing too many!"
25884,"Wow. Wow. Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. Come on, give me a hug."
25885,"Well, I'm not one for just talking."
25886,Does that drone do date nights with the wife?
25887,SINCE YOU CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY
25888,"Car, go park at work so people think I'm there."
25889,You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.
25890,More of what?
25891,"No. It's Elon. I don't care how much he likes me, I don't wanna be friends with him anymore. None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. Sky pies are lie pies! Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?"
25892,How do you break up with a guy?
25893,"Wow, you're good at that."
25894,Oh my God! Oh my God! You saved my life. Which is gonna make what I'm about to say even more awkward...
25895,"Elon, Elon, Elon! I want to say something to you and I don't want you to be inspired by it. I want you to listen."
25896,I don't want to be with you anymore.
25897,"I could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that PayPal was my idea and I was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am I."
25898,It's on your face too!
25899,"Well, I've saved you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain. Use it as you will."
25900,On a Miami Dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.
25901,When you're sixteen I'll drive you to Cincinnati. And you'll see what there is to see.
25902,Nothing.
25903,The little dolphin is also wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet... Wearing a helmet..
25904,I met a guy. A wonderful guy.
25905,Boy. Sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.
25906,Simpler time.
25907,What are you doing?
25908,Artists.
25909,I saved us seats!
25910,"Thank you, roll of masking tape!"
25911,Gonna be a tight fit.
25912,"Well, not Maggie."
25913,"Okay, okay. Standing O or die!"
25914,Woo hoo!
25915,Stop laughing at me!
25916,Stop fearing me!
25917,Dammit!
25918,Please keep spinning it. I don't wanna look at it.
25919,Can't you say something to make me feel better?
25920,"Fine. I got it. Starting right now, a year-long juice cleanse; every morning, I get a colonic, and I sleep in a sauna every night."
25921,"It's not about health, Marge. It's about going crazy."
25922,What the?
25923,Hmmm.
25924,This is it.
25925,"I'm sorry, I thought you were Over-feeders Anonymous."
25926,So... you guys are proud of what you are?
25927,Do you guys serve snacks?
25928,"I have so many questions for you. First of all, is this floor reinforced?"
25929,"You know, maybe I shouldn't be here. I promised my wife I'd lose weight."
25930,"Ooh, labels."
25931,Who are you?
25932,"Ooh, like Fat Albert."
25933,Sorry.
25934,I am big.
25935,I have a beauty of a sort to some.
25936,"Ditto. You know I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy."
25937,"Marge, kids! Tonight was a turning point in my life."
25938,"No, Marge! You have to listen! That place you sent me to changed my life!"
25939,"They taught me that I don't need to lose weight, I should just be proud of what I am."
25940,"It's not what you think. His name is Albert and he taught me not to buy into the lies taught by ""big nutrition."""
25941,"Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you. But I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight. Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale."
25942,"I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. It was a poem you were writing about my potential. I'm gonna start celebrating my size and I need you with me as a partner. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to the broken porch swing."
25943,"From now on, you guys can no longer say these hateful words."

25945,"Good. Good. By which I mean bad, bad."
25946,We never dreamed.
25947,"Sorry, fellas. There's a movement I have to join. I've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating."
25948,Right here.
25949,"Excuse me, pardon me, coming through."
25950,"Comin' back, 'scuse me, pardon me..."
25951,There we go. Comin' up... what can I do for you?
25952,"Guys, I'm comin' back in. Suck in your guts."
25953,I was distinctly promised no math!
25954,"Marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like Albert."
25955,"But Marge, I don't want you to ever stop caring about me."
25956,"Marge, I believe you're forgetting America's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: Professor X of the X-Men."
25957,"I've never written an eulogy before, but this time I did. Unfortunately, I left it at home."
25958,"Thanks, lady."
25959,What Albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. He knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...
25960,"Twenty-three?! People, for God's sake, join a gym."
25961,"Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself."
25962,"It will never happen again. Now come on, let's walk home."
25963,Can I ask you something? What is it that keeps you with me?
25964,"And because you love me, I will not stop yo-yo dieting till I get it right."
25965,At last.
25966,Marge! Stop that crazy thing!
25967,I'm not spending my precious Saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than I ever had.
25968,"Moe, quick! Beer me before I answer the phone!"
25969,I need it now!
25970,"Hey, Marge. I'm supposed to help drive the kids? Oh, man, I wish I knew that sooner, but I just had a beer."
25971,Woo hoo! Off the hook!
25972,"Yeah, while you're at it can you pick me up some beer?"
25973,Hey Moe... I'll take care of the bar. You did me a favor today.
25974,"Man, Moe's barely got two nickels to rub together."
25975,There's no guys! We haven't made any money.
25976,We don't look at you that way.
25977,Good ol' Dae Ho. Used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. And all I had to do was let him copy some keys.
25978,That's where all the problems are!
25979,"Look Moe, the least you could let me do is anything I want."
25980,"Well, that's the logic. Where's the affection?"
25981,Plant-watering guy.
25982,All right.
25983,What do I do now?
25984,"Oh, all right."
25985,"Well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school."
25986,"You know, Moe, you're a real jerk. I didn't mind so much when it came with beer."
25987,"Marge, which can makes me look cooler? The Drizzler or Mr. Drip?"
25988,"Aw, your leaves are drooping. Here, let me turn that gloom into bloom."
25989,Feminine?!
25990,So good to be back.
25991,'Cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. The Dirty Dozen? All guys. Twelve Angry Men? Men! The X-Men? Mostly men.
25992,Not my department.
25993,"Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. Shut your eyes."
25994,"Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!"
25995,"Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?"
25996,"Princess, why did you put on that coat? You're obviously cold. May I escort you to the radiator?"
25997,"Uh, just a second. Hey, Marge. Yeah, I'm workin' late. Yep, special project."
25998,"Sorry, Marge. But I am the royal babysitter. If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!"
25999,"I see. You want excitement. Princess, have you ever heard of Studio Fifty-Four, C-B-G-Bs, the Roxbury?"
26000,All gone. But in their place we have five hundred channels of television. All awesome. Sit down and I'll show you.
26001,"He's called ""The Bachelor."""
26002,"All right, Princess. I'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital F."
26003,Can I try it?
26004,"Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it."
26005,And you gave it to him?
26006,Eight million?
26007,Get outta here!
26008,She's gone!
26009,"Chief! Thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!"
26010,Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.
26011,What the?
26012,"Guys, thanks for bailing me out. But I still have a huge problem."
26013,"Um, yeah, sure. Hello, this is the princess. I'm with Homer Simpson and I do declare he's wonderful. Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa. Fiddle dee dee."
26014,Moe Szyslak!
26015,This is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV!
26016,"Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?"
26017,There was beer involved. I have two daughters. And I've learned you have to let them go their own way. Even the one-year-old.
26018,"And the older one, I can't tell her what to do. And she's only twelve."
26019,See what I mean? Always an argument.
26020,But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...
26021,"...uh, because you want them to grow..."
26022,...and because you can't strangle a girl.
26023,"Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like email updates from LinkedIn."
26024,"Go, go make magic. You just go."
26025,Revue...
26026,Oh boy oh boy.
26027,One AM lovin' and two AM steak? Night marriage rules! I guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.
26028,What are the skits about?
26029,How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
26030,"Nice. You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one."
26031,"You got yourself one hell of a show, Marge. One hell of a show."
26032,"Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else."
26033,"Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, ""Cats and Dogs"" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL"
26034,"CATS AND DOGS, SQUABBLE'S NEVER ENDING / EVEN WITH SO MUCH LEGISLATION PENDING!"
26035,"Well, I was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap..."
26036,If anything happens to Marge... we'll all be orphans!
26037,I'm comin' for ya baby!
26038,Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife?
26039,Do you know where she is?
26040,"All right, as long as it's just questions."
26041,Are you gonna put my head in a vise?
26042,Stole? How is counting cards stealing?
26043,Is it even cheating?
26044,"I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?"
26045,I knew you had a vise! I knew it!
26046,No deal!
26047,No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.
26048,I'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. They're just playing the game by the rules!
26049,On a beautiful night like tonight... how could I not?
26050,Tell a lie. Tell a lie.
26051,Don't tell him. Give him a fake name.
26052,Don't you get it? You gotta use a reverse psychology.
26053,Okay. Don't use reverse psychology.
26054,Donald Trump? No. Arnold Palmer? No. Bill Cosby? No.
26055,Bravo!
26056,Uh-oh. I don't understand a word he's saying. Why doesn't he just let me bat? I wish I was home with a big bag of potato chips... Mmm potato chips.
26057,I want some peanuts.
26058,Don't tell him you were at a bar! But what else is open at night?
26059,I would'a never thought of that.
26060,What does that mean? Better say something or they'll think you're stupid.
26061,Swish!
26062,"I thought this thing was going to be catered. Boy, am I hungry. I mean I'm really, really hungry."
26063,Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart!
26064,Don't say revenge. Don't say revenge.
26065,"That's it, I'm getting outta here."
26066,"""Special Day?"" Oh, what have I forgotten now? Now, don't panic... Is it Bacon Day? No, that's crazy talk... She's getting impatient, take a stab at it."
26067,"Little do they know, I'm ducking out early to take the Duff Brewery tour."
26068,"Heh, heh, heh, they don't suspect a thing. Well, off to the plant."
26069,Uh-oh. Did I say that or just think it?
26070,Don't think about beer.
26071,Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?
26072,Wait a minute. Is he coming on to me?
26073,"Oh my God, he is coming on to me."
26074,Yikes!
26075,"Oh man, I've really got to go to the bathroom. Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?"
26076,"This is it, Homer. It's time to tell her the terrible secret from your past."
26077,"No, the other secret."
26078,Don't panic. Just come up with a good story.
26079,Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts.
26080,Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
26081,Wait. Are you sure that's how this sort of thing works?
26082,Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
26083,"""You will find happiness with a new love."" Oh, even the Chinese are against me. What's the point. I can't fight fate."
26084,"Mental note: ""The girl knows too much."""
26085,"Something was said: not good. What was it? ""Don't yell at Homer."" No, that's okay. What was it? ""Slow."" They called you ""slow!"""
26086,Something said: not good...
26087,Eatthepuddingeatthepudding eatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthe pudding.
26088,Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
26089,You will find happiness with a new love.
26090,Quiet! It might be you. I can't remember.
26091,"No, no! Why embarrass us both? Just write a check and I'll release some more endorphins."
26092,"I've worked here for ten years, and my boss doesn't even know my name? Well, that's gonna change right now. My name is Homer J. Simp--"
26093,"I'm a big four-eyed lame-o and I wear the same stupid sweater every day, and..."
26094,Silence you fool! It can be ours.
26095,Oh glory of glories! Oh heavenly testament to the eternal majesty of God's creation!
26096,Now she'll really be surprised when she opens that ironing board cover!
26097,"There it is, Homer: the cleverest thing you'll ever say. And nobody heard it."
26098,Mental note: steal his idea.
26099,That cactus is right. I've only got one chance. I got to knock him out.
26100,"You can stay, but I'm leaving."
26101,"Quiet, you fool. You're on the one team that can't possibly be fired."
26102,"Mmm. Look at his eyes. He's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the good Las Vegas way."
26103,"Oh, you don't want to know what I really think. Now, look sad and say ""D'oh."""
26104,You're leaving the arm there too long! You wanna make it worse?!
26105,"No, no! He'll know you're on to him -- quick, shake his hand!"
26106,As...? As...?!
26107,Just don't bump me on your way out of the car.
26108,Keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake.
26109,I've already gone this far... I wonder what my life would be like if I robbed the Kwik-E- Mart?
26110,No! Must resist temptation!
26111,Bo-ring.
26112,Wow. That saxophone would make a great pipe.
26113,Don't you get it? They're using us as patsies to make the Army look good.
26114,"A cookie! No, a car! No, a cookie!"
26115,I'm not thinking. You think.
26116,"You have to think, it's your job."
26117,You idiot! Mr. Fatso is you!
26118,"That's right, numbskull! Your son's made a fool of you in front of the whole town!"
26119,"Well, I'll fix you. Go drive a car!"
26120,What the hell are you doing?!
26121,I'm doing the best with what I got! All you feed me is reality shows!
26122,I really wish I had fixed that faucet.
26123,"Okay Homer, don't speak. If you must make a sound, whistle."
26124,"When your wife looks at you, full of hope, with an idea that would destroy life as we know it..."
26125,"Just smile, nod... and stall, stall, stall..."
26126,...until she changes her mind.
26127,"All right! ""Try it"" means sex."
26128,"Okay, Homer. This is the moment of truth. You've gotta tell Marge you really don't want another kid."
26129,"Eh, how bad could it be?"
26130,"Uh-oh. She's picked names? Who puts this much thought into having a baby? Stall, stall, stall!"
26131,"There he is. The fat, pathetic slob I'd be with four kids."
26132,"Oh, right. That dad was there all along. Phew. That was so sweet! Maybe there's no such thing as too many kids."
26133,Don't blow the surprise. Pretend you forgot.
26134,"Uh-oh. If you're honest, you'll have to tell her about the train!"
26135,How stupid are you?
26136,Just for that I'm not going to help you.
26137,"Homer Simpson! Do you really want to keep cheating your friends, lying to your wife, and avoiding your kids? What would Jesus do?"
26138,"This simulation has been brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis."
26139,Marge thinks Flanders is annoying. This marriage just got interesting.
26140,She's so cute...
26141,Wow. Bart has feelings. Mrs. Doody.
26142,"No cops in sight. If I'm gonna save that clerk, I'm gonna have to take the law into my own hands again."
26143,"Lord, this is a dire emergency. If you could fix my house, or make a new house from one of my ribs..."
26144,Now for that happy period between the lie and the time it's found out.
26145,Mirror mirror on the wall: who's the baldest of them all?
26146,"Gee, I thought I had a bigger package than that."
26147,Don't worry -- they're just friends. There's nothing physical between them.
26148,"Uh-oh! I'm gonna have to work on my marriage. Or, alternatively..."
26149,Wait a minute. These guys don't know me. I can be whatever I want.
26150,"She's right, it was all me!"
26151,"Oh man, what do I do? Wait -- the book Marge gave me!"
26152,No book is gonna make my daughter sad. Time to do what I do best: lie to a child.
26153,"It's poison! Whatever you do, don't eat it."
26154,"Okay, you're already eating it, but don't finish it. Okay, you finished it, but don't ask for--"
26155,You moron! Just kill her!
26156,"Play it cool, Homer. Don't let her know it's perfect."
26157,A million dollars -- now I'm really glad I didn't die!
26158,"Wait... if I tell Marge I won, she'll know I was buying the ticket when I was supposed to be onstage with her. I'm rich and I can't even tell my own wife!"
26159,"Calm down, Homer. Calm down."
26160,Got to stay mad. The next morning is where the fight is won or lost.
26161,I'm buying it!
26162,"Okay, just imagine she's a Bond girl."
26163,Judi Dench?!
26164,Oh my God... is she flirting with me?
26165,"She is flirting with me. Okay, Homer, let her down easy. Don't go breaking any hearts."
26166,Grampa?!
26167,No I haven't!
26168,"Oh my God, Marge is here! What is she thinking now?"
26169,"You have regrets, Mr. ""I Get To See The Weathergirl From The Side?"" I made the worst financial decision of all time. Oh, I can't think about it, I won't think about it, I don't want to think about it..."
26170,Don't eat it. It's been in his ear. Don't eat it. It's been in his ear.
26171,Don't eat it. It's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth. Don't eat it.
26172,Finally. Time for the big bump-into.
26173,Wednesday?
26174,"Okay, she's always in a good mood after therapy..."
26175,Except that you're about to double-cross some gangsters.
26176,She'll forgive me...
26177,Especially this time...
26178,I mean it's Christmas...
26179,I wonder if there's birds on the moon. I miss Marge.
26180,"Whoa, he's getting serious. Is this what I really want?"
26181,There's no time to be careful.
26182,We're late.
26183,"Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred."
26184,Pardon my galoshes.
26185,"Oh, it's Lisa. That's ours."
26186,How many grades does this school have?
26187,Who shall I say is calling?
26188,It's your sister.
26189,"What? Why? Oh, yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip?"
26190,"Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?"
26191,Marge!
26192,"Marge, where's the extension cord?"
26193,Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.
26194,...Every year.
26195,A what!
26196,"Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance."
26197,Y'ello.
26198,Who's this?
26199,"This is her sister, isn't it?"
26200,"Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled. Marge! Turn on the juice!"
26201,"What do you think, kids?"
26202,"What is it, Flanders?"
26203,"It's too bright. That Flanders, what a big show-off."
26204,"Spill it, Marge. Where have you been hiding the Christmas money?"
26205,Oh! Big jar this year.
26206,Mm-hmm... Mmm-hmm... Mmm-hmm...
26207,Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
26208,"Oh, thank God for the big jar."
26209,Hey! What's with this?
26210,"It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone."
26211,"Oh, yeah my Christmas bonus. How silly of me. This'll be the best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had. Heh-heh."
26212,"Oh. I love you, Marge."
26213,"Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping."
26214,"Marge, well, let me be honest with you."
26215,Well... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year.
26216,"Marge, Marge, Marge. Let's see. Oooh, look! Pantyhose. Practical and alluring. A six-pack... Oh! Only four ninety nine."
26217,"Oooh... pads of paper. I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie. Oh, look, a little squeak-toy. . It says it's for dogs, but she can't read..."
26218,"Hello, Flanders."
26219,"Well, let's see."
26220,They're all yours.
26221,Gimme that!
26222,So?
26223,"Thanks, Moe."
26224,"What's with the crazy getup, Barn?"
26225,Wow. Can I do that?
26226,What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts?
26227,"Oh, I certainly do."
26228,"Huh, when do we get paid?"
26229,"Dasher, Dancer..."
26230,Prancer...
26231,"Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon."
26232,"And what would you like, little boy?"
26233,Why you little eggheaded...!
26234,"Oh, I knew that one, too."
26235,"Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub."
26236,You both look well.
26237,"Yeah, well, Merry Christmas."
26238,And why is that?
26239,"Well, I was just on my way out to get one."
26240,No!
26241,Uh-oh.
26242,"So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isn't it?"
26243,That's an ornament.
26244,"Ah, son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. Hey, I couldn't afford lunch. Gimme a bite of that donut."
26245,"I will when Mrs. Claus's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening, kid."
26246,"What's your name, Bart... ner? -- Er -- Little partner?"
26247,I'm Jolly Old Saint Nick.
26248,"I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop, little boy. Cover for me, Elfie."
26249,"Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, I'd do anything."
26250,"Now let's not get mushy, son. I still have a job to do."
26251,"Hey, little ones, Santa's back. Ho! Ho!"
26252,Arrgh! -- Damn it to...
26253,"Ah, son. One day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. Receiving a big fat check for a job well done."
26254,"Come on, son. Let's go cash this baby and get presents for -- Thirteen bucks? Hey, wait a minute!"
26255,Yeah.
26256,But...
26257,Santa?
26258,Wait a minute...
26259,But... but...
26260,Thirteen bucks. We can't get anything for thirteen bucks.
26261,What?
26262,"Bart, did you hear that? What a name -- ""Santa's Little Helper"". It's a sign! It's an omen!"
26263,"Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve."
26264,Uh-uh.
26265,"Well, okay. Let's go."
26266,Who's Tiny Tim?
26267,I can't believe I'm doing this.
26268,"Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind?"
26269,What! That scrawny little bag of bones?
26270,"Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas."
26271,What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?
26272,Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS!
26273,"Don't you believe in me, son?"
26274,"Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going."
26275,That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper.
26276,"Come on, Bart. Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it. Heh-heh-heh."
26277,"Come on Santa's Little Helper! Go, go, go! Run your tail off!"
26278,Go! Go!
26279,"Come on, boy."
26280,I don't want to leave till our dog finishes.
26281,"Ah, forget it. Let's go."
26282,"Find any winners, son?"
26283,"Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh."
26284,But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...
26285,#NAME?
26286,"All right, look everybody. I have a confession to make."
26287,"I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did, I just couldn't --"
26288,It is?
26289,"Number eight. I mean, Santa's Little Helper."
26290,Bart!
26291,Lisa!
26292,I'm warning you two!
26293,RUDOLPH WITH YOUR NOSE... OVER HERE... / SO YOU CAN GUIDE MY SLEIGH TODAY....
26294,Hmmmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
26295,"Oh, wait! Here's a good one -- ""do""."
26296,Hey! No abbreviations!
26297,"Hey, shut up, boy."
26298,We got one?
26299,Get outta here.
26300,"Wait a minute, you little cheater. You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is."
26301,I'll show you a big dumb balding ape!
26302,"That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. Hey, look at this! ""I am a weiner."" He sure is!"
26303,"What have you done this time, boy?"
26304,"Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?"
26305,"Oh, no. He can't mean that."
26306,My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
26307,Oh.
26308,What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
26309,A what?
26310,This lunkhead?
26311,Nine hundred and twelve?
26312,Oh.
26313,"Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show."
26314,"Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?"
26315,"How 'bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties."
26316,"Sorry, boy."
26317,"Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today."
26318,"It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe you should try some of this."
26319,"I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up."
26320,Gotcha!
26321,"Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie."
26322,The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
26323,"Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone."
26324,"So, how was it?"
26325,What?
26326,"Wow! What are you readin' there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?"
26327,"Tell you what: To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"
26328,But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?
26329,Jeez. No beer... no opera dogs...
26330,"Don't stifle the boy, Marge. We're supposed to encourage him."
26331,Who's the lard butt?
26332,P.U. When is this over?
26333,"Is that one fat enough for you, son?"
26334,Let's go get a burger.
26335,"Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball."
26336,"Well, I guess we don't have to do that."
26337,"Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark."
26338,"Can you still see the ball, Bart?"
26339,"Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat."
26340,"So what was it you wanted to tell me, son?"
26341,"Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son."
26342,"Don't be discouraged, son. I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb."
26343,"What is it, son?"
26344,What?
26345,"Why, you little -- !"
26346,You can't stay in there forever!
26347,March your butt right out here. Now!
26348,"But -- son, if you don't come out I can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better."
26349,Nothin's easy.
26350,"You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. Hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet?"
26351,You're right! I gotta get where the action is!
26352,Comin' through.
26353,"Oh, hi, boy!"
26354,"But, sir, I --"
26355,Those perfectionists? Forget it.
26356,I'm no Supervising Technician. I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless nothing.
26357,"You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied, and I'll take anything. Watch out, Springfield, here I come."
26358,I'm just a Technical Supervisor who cared too much.
26359,"You'll get that punk someday, Moe."
26360,"Moe, I think I'll have another -- -- Whoops. Moe, I'm a little low on funds. You think could cover me just this once?"
26361,Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation.
26362,Oh.
26363,I'm fine. I'm just thinking.
26364,You think you can still do that kind of work?
26365,Beer! Now there's a temporary solution.
26366,"There must be some beer here somewhere... Ah, maybe in here."
26367,Damn!
26368,I need money!
26369,"Oh, no, what have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure..."
26370,Not even close.
26371,"""Dear Family: I am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, have courage and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life. Warmest regards, Love Homer J. Simpson."""
26372,Almost there.
26373,"Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going!"
26374,"Well, live and learn."
26375,"Boy, this intersection is dangerous! Someone ought to put a stop sign here."
26376,"Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign."
26377,Wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley
26378,"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --"
26379,I think we should put a stop sign at D Street and Twelfth. The other --
26380,Wow. They listened to me.
26381,"Hey, if they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken."
26382,Proud. Proud of what?
26383,"Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together."
26384,I'm talking about that!
26385,"What did you say, son?"
26386,That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.
26387,Thank you.
26388,"Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur."
26389,"Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!"
26390,Privately?
26391,"Stay here, I'll be right back."
26392,Same here.
26393,"Sorry, no can do!"
26394,"Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about."
26395,Hey! What's the problem here?
26396,"Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I..."
26397,Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.
26398,What?
26399,"Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --"
26400,"Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back."
26401,"I can't do it, Mr. Burns."
26402,"Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job."
26403,I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
26404,"Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us."
26405,...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
26406,"But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!"
26407,Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.
26408,"You were? Aw, well go ahead."
26409,"Look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic."
26410,Mmmm! Marshmallow!
26411,"I'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can, Marge. I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic."
26412,Are you sure that's enough? You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
26413,"Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word ""bonehead""."
26414,"There it is, kids... Stately Burns Manor. Heaven on earth."
26415,"Okay, now look. My boss is gonna be at this picnic, so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect."
26416,"Afternoon, Mr. Burns."
26417,"Simpson, Homer."
26418,"Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts."
26419,"Why you, listen to me you..."
26420,"No, heh, heh, heh. Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man."
26421,"Now, remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family."
26422,Be normal! Be normal!
26423,Bart!
26424,Bart! Lisa! Maggie!
26425,"Where are you, kids?"
26426,Gotcha!
26427,Marge! Knock it off!
26428,Is it used?
26429,You remember the rules from last year?
26430,"Bart! No! No! No, no! Oh no, Bart, No! Don't! Noooo!"
26431,"Marge, I need you."
26432,"Snap out of it, Marge. You've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!"
26433,"Well, you picked a perfect time to start."
26434,Wahhhhhhhhh!
26435,Marge!
26436,"Quick, Bart, give me a kiss."
26437,"Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss."
26438,"Boy, I'm glad that's over. Now we can go home and act normal again."
26439,"Oh come on. That cornball routine. ""I love you, Daddy."" Give me a break."
26440,Why?
26441,"Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family."
26442,Yes.
26443,No. We're going to say grace first.
26444,"No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous. Oh, Lord, why did you smite me with this family?"
26445,No! I'm not done yet.
26446,"I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town."
26447,"You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow me."
26448,"Look at that, kids! No fighting, no yelling..."
26449,Yahhhhhhhh!
26450,"Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind Door Number Two."
26451,I wish I could hear what they're saying.
26452,Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.
26453,It's worse than you think. I just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.
26454,"No, no. I want to be alone with my thought."
26455,"Another beer, Moe."
26456,I've got some wieners in my pocket.
26457,"You know, Moe, my Mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said, ""Homer, you're a big disappointment,"" and, God bless her soul, she was really onto something."
26458,"You can't talk that way about my kids. Or, at least two of them."
26459,"Why, you... Here's five you haven't met."
26460,Huh... what?
26461,When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They're on TV!
26462,"All right, time for a family meeting!"
26463,"Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help. Professional help. So I made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe."
26464,"Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference."
26465,"Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study. And of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. All it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars."
26466,"Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund."
26467,"Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?"
26468,That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
26469,"Well, we're not licked yet. To save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice."
26470,"Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here."
26471,Would you pay one hundred fifty dollars for this lovely Motorola?
26472,Ready as she'll ever be!
26473,"Hey, no pain, no gain."
26474,"Cash, of course. I've got two hundred and fifty dollars right here with me. I'm holding it right now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. Two hundred and fifty big ones."
26475,Bart!
26476,Lisa!
26477,"Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention."
26478,Good idea.
26479,Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?
26480,Unortho what?
26481,Arrrgh!
26482,Why you...
26483,"Oh, yes, doctor."
26484,Arrrgh!
26485,Arrrgh!
26486,Arrrgh!
26487,"Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!"
26488,Wow! Five hundred smackers!
26489,That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
26490,Do I smell cupcakes?
26491,"Oooo, Do I ever!"
26492,Ah. Say no more.
26493,No.
26494,"Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing."
26495,"Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little."
26496,"Surely, Lisa. You see how it works, Bart? A cupcake here, a good grade there."
26497,"Yeah, right, Lis. It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and..."
26498,"Yeah, and I got the day off from work."
26499,"But what's a day off from work when I'm never gonna see my beloved son again. Oh, Bart. Oh, Bart."
26500,"Tough day at school, boy?"
26501,"So you had a little scuffle, eh? Hope you won."
26502,"Bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something."
26503,"Come on, Bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. Here, let me help you dry those tears."
26504,"So, what's the problem, son?"
26505,"Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa."
26506,What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.
26507,"The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?"
26508,"Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh."
26509,"Aw, Marge."
26510,"Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy."
26511,Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
26512,"No, no! Not like that! Like this!"
26513,"See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he."
26514,"Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own."
26515,"So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded..."
26516,And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
26517,"And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations."
26518,"Remember the family jewels, son."
26519,"Awright, you kids, keep it down! Am I making myself... ?"
26520,"You, up in the tree! The tall gray­ haired kid! Get your butt down here right now!"
26521,"What about you, boy?"
26522,Cupcakes.
26523,"Not now, Marge."
26524,"Lisa! Lisa, are you still in there? What's the problem? Did you fall in? Lisa!"
26525,Wha' th--
26526,"Where the hell are my keys? Who stole my keys? Come on, I'm late for work."
26527,The den! Great idea!
26528,Do you know where my keys are?
26529,Rumpus room. Great idea!
26530,Bart!
26531,"All right. Hey, hey!"
26532,"Come on, come on. Let's go."
26533,Must you do this every time?
26534,"Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!"
26535,Okay. Here we go.
26536,"Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!"
26537,Ohhh... get out of the corner!
26538,"What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way."
26539,Lisa?
26540,"""Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad."" Well, she doesn't look sad. I don't see any tears in her eyes."
26541,"Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like ""my stomach hurts"" or ""I'm going crazy"". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?"
26542,Well... eh... er...eh...
26543,"Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee!"
26544,Thanks for knowing I mean well.
26545,"You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!"
26546,"In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!"
26547,No.
26548,"Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze."
26549,I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa!
26550,"Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?"
26551,"Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy."
26552,Let's hear it.
26553,You just clack as loud as you want. Lis.
26554,What th...
26555,"Bart, go easy on me. I'm your Dad."
26556,"No, Bart, no."
26557,"You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?"
26558,"Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing."
26559,"Oh, no, Marge!"
26560,"Marge, are you all right?"
26561,"Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!"
26562,"Oh. Me, too."
26563,Bart!
26564,Gimme some quarters. I'm doing my laundry.
26565,Where's the video boxing?
26566,"Hey, that kid's pretty good."
26567,"No, me! No, Me!"
26568,Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?
26569,"Aw, come on."
26570,You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
26571,"That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight."
26572,Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.
26573,"Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh."
26574,"Kid, tonight's not your night."
26575,Oh! Oh! Block it.
26576,Uh-oh. You missed me.
26577,Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill.
26578,"Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment."
26579,"Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right."
26580,"Oh, noooo!"
26581,"My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close."
26582,What?
26583,"Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses."
26584,Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features?
26585,A satellite dish!
26586,"But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do."
26587,Oooh! Credit.
26588,I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
26589,Where is it?
26590,Does it have a deep fryer?
26591,Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
26592,"Hey, how much is it?"
26593,"Yeah, how much is it?"
26594,You do?
26595,No.
26596,Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
26597,Oh.
26598,"Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob."
26599,How much do you want for it?
26600,I swear it Bob.
26601,Yeah!
26602,On my honor.
26603,"Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?"
26604,Yeah!
26605,No.
26606,All right. All right! I'll take it.
26607,Hey Flanders! Look what I got!
26608,Jealous. Everybody ready?
26609,"that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come!"
26610,Bart!
26611,Lisa!
26612,I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game.
26613,Pfft. Maps.
26614,Don't worry. This is an all-terrain vehicle.
26615,"Ah, come on. We're going back to nature."
26616,What do you think? Should we stop here?
26617,All righty.
26618,"Well, here we are!"
26619,"Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One..."
26620,"Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers."
26621,"Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this."
26622,Will somebody help her?
26623,Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
26624,"Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings."
26625,What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.
26626,I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all.
26627,Shut up!
26628,Shut up... shut up... shut up.
26629,There! Finished.
26630,"Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter."
26631,"Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax."
26632,"That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods."
26633,"Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone."
26634,"And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of."
26635,A rattler!
26636,"Run, you fool!"
26637,"Through here, boy. Back to civilization."
26638,"When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. It becomes natural. Like a third sense."
26639,"Bart? Where are you, Bart?"
26640,His lucky red hat! Oh dear God! No! Bart!
26641,"Bart! Oh Bart! Bart, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son. Why couldn't you have taken me? Of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?"
26642,What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
26643,What? Oooh! Jungle Man!
26644,"The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: Conceal your nakedness."
26645,"Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town."
26646,"Ah food. Good thinking, son."
26647,This young sapling ought to do the trick.
26648,"No. This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."
26649,Shhhh! Just watch.
26650,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!"
26651,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
26652,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Aaah!
26653,"G-g-good night, s-son. S-sleep tight."
26654,No.
26655,How would I know. Quit asking pointless... Bart look!
26656,Honey! Honey! We're saved!
26657,Tangy.
26658,Wah-neh! Wah-neh!
26659,Wah neh! Wah neh!
26660,Pleehhh! Hnnnn! Plem! Feh!
26661,Femmmmm! Wah! Gnnn! Hrmmerhrr!
26662,Plemk heh feh.
26663,Just a little farther... just a little further... just a little further. Food!
26664,Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles.
26665,Praise the grizzles son.
26666,Maggie! Oh my little girl!
26667,"Nice grizzly, nice grizzly."
26668,"Avenge me, son. Avenge my death."
26669,Can I have some apple sauce?
26670,"Oh, Marge. The guys at work are going to have a field day with this."
26671,"Ooh, those stupid eggheads."
26672,"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh."
26673,"They've got us cornered, boy. We'll never get away. Give me the head."
26674,No!
26675,"Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob."
26676,"We'll die together, like a father and son should."
26677,Get him!
26678,Oh no.
26679,No!
26680,No we don't. Try being objective for once in your... oooh!
26681,"But you don't understand, Marge. I have fifty bucks riding on this game."
26682,"This isn't gambling, Marge. It's a lead pipe cinch."
26683,Oh no!
26684,Where is it. The game... where is it?
26685,Ah!
26686,Catch it! catch it!
26687,All right!
26688,Lazar who?
26689,"Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!"
26690,Maybe.
26691,"Make it, make it, make it, make it."
26692,"Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
26693,It's good! It's good! It's good!
26694,It's good to see you all in church.
26695,What? Oh yeah. You were great.
26696,What was it about?
26697,"Oh! He didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?"
26698,What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?
26699,"I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?"
26700,Marge. They're only space mutants.
26701,I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
26702,"Here you go, son. Share the wealth, that's what I always say."
26703,"Wow! Look at these bowling balls, Maggie. Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his hard won fifty bucks?"
26704,"Now I've seen everything. Black marbleized with a liquid center. The ""Stealth Bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em."
26705,"Sure, boy. What's on your mind?"
26706,"I'm glad you asked, son. Being popular is the most important thing in the world."
26707,"You're not talking about killing anyone, are you?"
26708,Are you?
26709,Then run along you little scamp. A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
26710,"Oooh. Look at this one. ""The Hammer of Thor. It will send your pins to Valhalla."" Lisa?"
26711,"Ooooh, that's some ball."
26712,Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue?
26713,I knew it all along.
26714,Yeah? Why you little...
26715,"Lay off the boy, Marge. He's a good kid. Quit givin' him the third degree."
26716,"Well, maybe I am a little responsible."
26717,"C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities."
26718,"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh."
26719,"Good going, son. But remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice."
26720,Huh? Whuh?
26721,My birthday?
26722,It's my birthday? What did I get? I love birthdays.
26723,"Of course I know! Sure! You really thought I forgot, didn't you?"
26724,"Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block."
26725,"Oh, no. Come on, come on! Open up!"
26726,Ah... no.
26727,Too salty...
26728,"Ummm, nah..."
26729,"Hmmm. Nah, too corny..."
26730,Too exciting.
26731,Hmmmm!
26732,Be right there.
26733,"Ah, sounds delightful. Just you and me and the balladeers."
26734,Fair enough.
26735,"What's that, Patty?"
26736,Bart!
26737,Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.
26738,"Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?"
26739,"Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does."
26740,"You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second. So, please say something back, Marge, please. I'm gonna stop talking... now."
26741,What? No...
26742,"I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?"
26743,"Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back."
26744,So you'd know it's from me!
26745,What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
26746,Well... you're welcome.
26747,"Now this is living, eh, kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings."
26748,"Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. Does the time always drag like this?"
26749,"Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us."
26750,"Eat, mm-hm."
26751,"Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in."
26752,"All right, we're clean. Now we'll... put Maggie to bed."
26753,"Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?"
26754,"Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing."
26755,Oh? You're going back?
26756,"Uh, no, I don't mind."
26757,'Night.
26758,Marge?
26759,Nothing.
26760,For Marge?
26761,"Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball."
26762,"Oh, sorry... ouch!"
26763,I gave you advice? Get outta here.
26764,Hmm. Good advice.
26765,"Marge, may I speak to you?"
26766,"You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You've just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...Goodbye, my wife."
26767,Starving.
26768,How can I eat it? She made it. It's all I have left.
26769,Marge!
26770,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
26771,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.
26772,"Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick. And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance."
26773,"Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly."
26774,"Just keepin' you on your toes, babe."
26775,"Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning."
26776,"Oh no! Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. I'm a whale. Why was I was cursed with this weakness for snack treats? Well, from now on, exercise every morning, Homer."
26777,"Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance."
26778,"No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing."
26779,"No, my supervisor."
26780,"Hey, what is this? The Spanish Exposition?"
26781,Bart! What are you doing?
26782,Where am I... the Planet Cornball?
26783,Oooh... entertainment.
26784,"Hey, shut up!"
26785,"Ooh, look at him squirm."
26786,"I'm sorry, I don't usually laugh like this."
26787,"Oh, this is the most fun I've had in my whole life."
26788,"One glazed and one scratch-and-win, please."
26789,"Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone."
26790,"Oooh, Liberty bell! Another liberty bell! One more and I'm a millionaire. Come on, Liberty bell! Please, please, please please, please please. That purple fruit thing! Where were you yesterday?"
26791,"What are you on, pal?"
26792,"Well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!"
26793,"Man, you get a lot of nutcases in here."
26794,"I hear ya, buddy! Whew! Full moon!"
26795,Hmmm... still got it!
26796,"I-it's meaningless, Marge. Don't even attempt to find meaning in it. There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir."
26797,Your photo?
26798,Why you little --
26799,Look Marge... honey... baby doll... I...
26800,"What are you saying, Honey?"
26801,But where will I sleep?
26802,Would a motel be okay?
26803,"Aw, I knew you'd come to your..."
26804,"Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture."
26805,"Motel, I guess."
26806,"Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on."
26807,Barney!
26808,"Don't listen to him, Marge, he's..."
26809,"No, Barn. I just want to crawl into bed."
26810,Oh no.
26811,"What do you mean, sir?"
26812,"It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?"
26813,"Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy."
26814,"I don't really know, sir."
26815,"Well... Uh... Wine 'em, dine 'em, bring 'em flowers, write 'em love poetry, sir."
26816,Anybody home?
26817,How's your Mom?
26818,"Oh, thanks, boy."
26819,"Hello, Marge. It's me. Homer."
26820,Are you still mad?... You are still mad. No need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk.
26821,"Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
26822,Yes I do. Because I'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.
26823,"Oh, he does not!"
26824,"So what should I do, Marge?"
26825,"Okay. Your wish is my command, my little..."
26826,"You see, I'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects."
26827,Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?
26828,Marge. Marge. We're gonna try one more place. The Sapphire Lounge. Bart! I said look at the floor!
26829,"There she is! Hey, Princess! It's me, the guy from the snap shot!"
26830,Oooo.
26831,"Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object."
26832,"I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too."
26833,Could you tell him a little about yourself?
26834,Thank you very much ma'am. We'll be out of your...
26835,Oh no.
26836,Ahhhhhh!
26837,ABOUT A MILLION GIRLS.
26838,Hep... heyyy... whoooo... look out... yeah... Da da da da da.
26839,Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop the music... Quiet please... I have something to say. Quiet!
26840,"Quiet! I have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as it sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong, or am I right?"
26841,Marge!
26842,"Jeez, Louise. Look at this mess."
26843,I told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun--
26844,My back! There goes my back again!
26845,"Go get help, boy."
26846,"Oh, Maggie. My poor back."
26847,The boy. Bring me the boy.
26848,Oh Marge! I still hurt! Marge! Marge!
26849,"Actually, I was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich?"
26850,Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.
26851,"And maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. Oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup."
26852,Marge! Marge! Marge! Get the door.
26853,"Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me."
26854,That old gag.
26855,"Hear him out, Marge."
26856,"Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months."
26857,"Yeah, but what about Bart?"
26858,"Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?"
26859,You mean all white with pink eyes?
26860,He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.
26861,"Bon voyage, boy."
26862,"I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room."
26863,"Goodbye, Bart."
26864,Be good.
26865,You gotta be kiddin'. The lek?
26866,Give me the old stars and stripes.
26867,Political what?
26868,"Affectionate little Albanian, isn't he?"
26869,"Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers."
26870,"Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing."
26871,"Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her."
26872,Just kidding.
26873,"Nice and cozy, Adil?"
26874,"Look, Adil. You can call me Dad."
26875,Aww. You called me dad.
26876,You want to see where I work?
26877,None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
26878,"Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet."
26879,"See these? American donuts. Glazed, powdered, and raspberry filled. Now how's that for freedom of choice?"
26880,Uh... maybe. Hold on a second.
26881,"Hey, Lenny. Does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?"
26882,Sector Twelve?
26883,"Oh, that Sector Twelve."
26884,"Come along, Adil."
26885,You little shutterbug.
26886,Cheese!
26887,"Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that."
26888,"Okay, okay. I love Bart. Well..."
26889,Well?
26890,Darn tootin'.
26891,"Honey, I'm home."
26892,"Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to."
26893,"Ooh, trouble in the neighborhood. Let's check it out."
26894,"I'm his neighbor, what'd he do?"
26895,Oooo.
26896,Wow!
26897,Aw!
26898,Hmmm.
26899,Gee whiz. Adil would get a kick out of seeing this.
26900,Adil! Oh... there you are.
26901,"Ouch! Watch it! Hey. Ow, Ouch!"
26902,"So, he's going to prison?"
26903,"Goodbye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted."
26904,"He needs me. Hey, boy."
26905,"Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle."
26906,"Did you hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French."
26907,Y'ello.
26908,"Oooh, premium -- wait a minute. Why?"
26909,"How you doin', Apu?"
26910,"Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... New flavor! Triple chocolate!"
26911,Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
26912,"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
26913,"Sorry, pal..."
26914,And he had a big nose.
26915,"No, bigger. And big red hair that came out to... yeah, yeah like that."
26916,Yeah. Wait a minute. It's the guy from TV. My kid's hero... Cruddy... Crummy... Krusty the Clown!
26917,"Well, uh... m-maybe you better run off to bed..."
26918,"Yes, sir."
26919,"Well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty."
26920,"Oh, definitely number... Heh heh..."
26921,Four.
26922,I'm home everybody.
26923,"Oh fantastic. Marge, you're never gonna believe what happened. I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my own business when... Oooh oooh, ooh, the news."
26924,Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
26925,"He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?"
26926,"The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
26927,Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was there... the clown's G-I-L-L -T-Y.
26928,"Sorry, son. You'll understand one day."
26929,"Yes, sir."
26930,"Yes, I do."
26931,Okay.
26932,"No, I'm not. I'm hopping on the bandwagon. Now come on, son, get with the winning team."
26933,"Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated."
26934,Oooh.
26935,Ahhhh!
26936,"Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those whack-os."
26937,Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.
26938,"I hope you do find that punk someday, Moe. Fill 'er up."
26939,"Let's just say, I don't feel like goin' home tonight. Jar, please."
26940,You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
26941,What?
26942,"What? Hey, Barney, am I a pig?"
26943,"Oh, no."
26944,"Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that."
26945,I read you loud and clear.
26946,Uh... I'd like some flowers.
26947,"Uh, you know, pretty ones. Like that."
26948,"One, please."
26949,"Marge, I uh... love you. Marge, honey, I love you. Ohhh... Marge, I love you, baby. Hmm, Marge, sweetie, hooney, honey... Aah, this'll never work."
26950,"I love you, Marjorie."
26951,...and I've made reservations at the Chez Paree.
26952,"It matters not, mon frere. And after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the Off Ramp Inn."
26953,Oops.
26954,"Hello, this is Mr... Sampson."
26955,"No. I said Sampson, not Simpson."
26956,"Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family."
26957,"BA, BA / BA, BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA / BA, BA BA!"
26958,"BA, BA / BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA..."
26959,"You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man."
26960,"Son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo."
26961,"Out, boy, out."
26962,Smooth as a baby's behind.
26963,"I think you're right, dumplin'."
26964,"BART, GET THE DOOR!"
26965,"Well, don't just stand there, boy. Help Miss Botz with her suitcases."
26966,Bye kids. Watch out for the boy.
26967,They all look so tasty. But I think I'll eat this one right there.
26968,Why?
26969,"Oh, okay. Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes."
26970,"Oui, oui. After you. And I'll be seeing you later."
26971,Because I'm so carefree?
26972,More champagne?
26973,Ooops. Time for a fill-up. Garçon! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.
26974,"You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating."
26975,Don't forget to tell me when you see the off-ramp.
26976,No problemo. We'll just get off at the next exit.
26977,"Come on, Marge. Let me carry you over the threshold."
26978,"Sheesh, eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it."
26979,"Ooh, your blue thing with the things?"
26980,"Well, shake a leg, Mama."
26981,Whoa!
26982,Mmmm.
26983,So?
26984,All right. I suppose my work here is done.
26985,I don't like the looks of this.
26986,Ms. Botz? Ms. Botz?
26987,Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now?
26988,"We're so sorry, we're so sorry."
26989,"Oh, these things are heavy."
26990,"Just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay. No, no, triple."
26991,Sure.
26992,"Ain't that the truth. You know, one time he --"
26993,"Just a minute, young man. I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your babysitter and pay her off so that --"
26994,The what?
26995,"Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her. This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle."
26996,"Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again."
26997,"Lord help me, I'm just not that bright."
26998,Yeah. Yeah!
26999,"Honey, can we make up again?"
27000,"Eww, I hate that icky soup skin."
27001,"Mmmm. Marge, Could you get me another beer, please?"
27002,Sure I do. I just want to have a beer while I'm caring. Marge...
27003,"What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper."
27004,"I'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. Well as long as I'm here, I might as well kill two birds with one stone."
27005,Look at those funny little whiskers. Oooo! That reminds me. It's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. C'mon boy.
27006,"Oooh, ""Gorilla, The Conqueror."" The granddaddy of them all."
27007,It's so unfair... just because he's different.
27008,"Burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? Go get 'em."
27009,Psst... Marge. Come take a look at this.
27010,"Just a little dim, I guess."
27011,What?
27012,I wish I had Amoria Phlebitis.
27013,I have hair!... I have hair!
27014,"Hey, Dr. J."
27015,Hmmm...
27016,Hmmm huh.
27017,Hmmmm
27018,"And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids."
27019,I have hair! Look! Look!
27020,Whoo hoo! All right!
27021,Yeah!
27022,"Got ya, Burnsie."
27023,"Dear God, give a bald guy a break. Amen."
27024,We're proud of you boy.
27025,Hitler.
27026,"Hey, I'm still beating you, boy."
27027,"Okay. The colors of the Italian flag are red, white and what?"
27028,I was right.
27029,Miracle breakthrough! There's been a miracle breakthrough?
27030,Hair... hair... Just like everybody else.
27031,"Marge, weren't you listening? This is a miracle breakthrough. Not one of these cheapo sucker deals."
27032,Great! Great! Great! How much? How much? How much?
27033,A thousand bucks. I can't afford that.
27034,"A thousand bucks. Of all the rip-off -- screw job -- gyp joint... forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!"
27035,"So I say ""Forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!"", and I storm right outta there."
27036,Out of tartar sauce.
27037,"They call this a portion? Hey Lenny, are you gonna use all your tartar sauce? Dry fish sticks. This sucks."
27038,"If I had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that."
27039,But it's a thousand bucks... Burns would can my butt in no time flat.
27040,"Nothing... well, that newsletter."
27041,You got me!
27042,"Uh, I'd like to charge that Dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance?"
27043,"Good morning, Springfield! Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Winfield!"
27044,"Good morning, Moe's Tavern!"
27045,"Good morning, everybody!"
27046,Gimme the usual.
27047,"Daddy's home, Sugar!"
27048,"Ah, dinner with three beautiful women. I must be in heaven."
27049,"Well, your resume seems in order. Besides typing and stuff, do you have any other qualifications I should know about?"
27050,"No, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye."
27051,Hello?
27052,"Oh Marge, every woman I i­n­t­e­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me."
27053,"I'll call you back, Marge."
27054,"Yes, Mr. Smithers."
27055,He thinks he's so big.
27056,Huh?
27057,Who told you?
27058,I... I de...
27059,I de...
27060,I deserve this.
27061,I deserve this!
27062,I AM NATURE'S GREATEST MIRACLE!
27063,"YOU GOT IT, BUDDY!"
27064,Ooh. Beauty.
27065,Do any of these suits do that?
27066,"Ooh, I like this."
27067,"Gotta run, Marge. Can't be late."
27068,What? Our anniversary? Are you sure?
27069,Hello?
27070,"I love you, Karl -- Marge."
27071,"Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks."
27072,"Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them."
27073,"Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out."
27074,"Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody."
27075,The key!
27076,"Sure thing, Mr. Burns."
27077,"Can do, sir."
27078,"Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?"
27079,Yea... eh... how about a pony?
27080,"Uh, well okay, what the hey?"
27081,"Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?"
27082,What?
27083,You did?
27084,"Karl, you saved me. Why?"
27085,"Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say."
27086,"Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you."
27087,No.
27088,"Bart, what are you doing?"
27089,Why you little...
27090,Ahhhh!
27091,Boy must die.
27092,"Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary."
27093,"I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?"
27094,Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?
27095,"Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. Look at me!"
27096,What do you mean?
27097,"No, I can't. I'm just a big fool."
27098,How do you know?
27099,Karl.
27100,A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.
27101,"Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of..."
27102,Five thousand two... I mean... Lots of money.
27103,"Uh, why?"
27104,I don't know... a hundred and two?
27105,"What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you."
27106,"Oh, better hurry up."
27107,I've never been more awake in my life.
27108,"Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald."
27109,And... and?! What about loving me?
27110,What?!
27111,I'M EVERYTHING YOU NEED /
27112,HOMER MARGE
27113,"to me."""
27114,Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
27115,Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.
27116,"There you are, my man. And a dollar for yourself."
27117,Huh? Well... it's all ours!
27118,"Motivated seller, Marge."
27119,So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.
27120,Probably just the house settling.
27121,I don't know.
27122,"Ooh, a vortex."
27123,Catch.
27124,Hey! Pretty slick!
27125,"Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one."
27126,"Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother."
27127,"Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here..."
27128,Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!
27129,It's got great high ceilings.
27130,Tell you what -- let's sleep on it. Okay?
27131,What could happen?
27132,They are all against me! They all must die!
27133,"Marge! Oh, Marge!"
27134,"Aw, come on, Marge. You said you'd sleep on it."
27135,An ancient Indian what...?
27136,"Mr. Ploot? Homer Simpson here. When you sold me this house you forgot to mention one little thing. You didn't tell me it was built on an Indian burial ground. No you didn't! Well, that's not my recollection... Yeah! Well... all right, goodbye. He says he mentioned it five or six times."
27137,"Aw, gee, Marge."
27138,Not to worry. I'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.
27139,Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww!
27140,Wow!
27141,"Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh, heh."
27142,"That should just about do it. Man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection..."
27143,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly."
27144,Hey! Get a load of that spread.
27145,Smothered pork chops.
27146,The girl's right. Let's get some applesauce out here for these pork chops.
27147,"What are you lookin' at, buddy?"
27148,"Oooh, thanks."
27149,Marge and I played that old game before we were married.
27150,"Oooh, a feast."
27151,Tell us more about this feast.
27152,"Marge, she's right."
27153,"Listen, you big stupid space creature. Nobody, but nobody eats the Simpsons."
27154,Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.
27155,"Yeah, thanks Lisa."
27156,Huh?
27157,"'Tis some visitor,"
27158,#NAME?
27159,"Oh, Lenore."
27160,Aag!
27161,'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- This it is and nothing more.
27162,Sir --
27163,"-- or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you."
27164,Surely --
27165,"-- surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --"
27166,"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --"
27167,"-- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
27168,Ouch! Censer..
27169,Wretch --
27170,"-- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
27171,"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"
27172,"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
27173,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
27174,Why you little --!
27175,"Come back here now, Raven"
27176,"Oh no, Marge. Come on, please."
27177,"Oh... oh, I hate Halloween."
27178,"Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time."
27179,Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --
27180,So... Someone will punch in for me.
27181,I'll mutant you.
27182,"Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. Why can't I ever get here on time?"
27183,"Uh, uh, just resting my eyes."
27184,Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
27185,"Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me."
27186,"Echo, echo..."
27187,"Huh? What th... Uh, Mr. Burns?"
27188,"Sorry, sir. It's just me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right?"
27189,"Uh... uh yes, sir."
27190,"Ooooh, cushy."
27191,"Well, nobody's perfect."
27192,"You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently."
27193,"I bet you could afford it, though."
27194,"Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't."
27195,"Where are we going, sir?"
27196,"If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?"
27197,"Well, he's got my vote."
27198,Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.
27199,"Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had."
27200,"I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey."
27201,"Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns Booster. Ow!"
27202,"Not yet, son. Not yet."
27203,"Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner."
27204,"And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them."
27205,"Come on, Marge."
27206,"Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this."
27207,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
27208,"Marge! Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow."
27209,"Marge, get back in bed."
27210,What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.
27211,What's that got to do with it?
27212,"But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve."
27213,Huh?
27214,"Hey! Hello, handsome!"
27215,"Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns."
27216,"Are you all right, Mr. Burns?"
27217,"Bart, would you like to say grace?"
27218,"""You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"""
27219,I was only reading what the card...
27220,"Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns..."
27221,"Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?"
27222,"Hey, you did it!"
27223,"Aw, Barney."
27224,"Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me."
27225,"Well, okay. It all started on ""Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night,"" down at Springfield stadium."
27226,"You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day."
27227,"Sure, we get a nice mix here."
27228,"Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here."
27229,What are you getting at?
27230,"Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself."
27231,"Uh... Simp-sons, sir."
27232,"Oh, that's okay. The baby's name isn't important. Let's go, Marge."
27233,"What's the matter, boy?"
27234,"Wow! Flash Bailor came on to my wife! You've still got the magic, Marge."
27235,Whoa!
27236,Hey everybody! How you doin'? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Heh...heh.
27237,Examine my zipper? Why? Whoops!
27238,"Thanks, everybody."
27239,"Hey, Burns! Hey, ""Rag Arm""!"
27240,"Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!"
27241,"Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks..."
27242,Rub it in.
27243,"Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns."
27244,"Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer."
27245,"Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?"
27246,"Good one, sir."
27247,LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER!
27248,"Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name."
27249,Don't mind if I do.
27250,"All right, Burnsie."
27251,C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.
27252,"What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!"
27253,Your team needs you! C'mon!!!
27254,"As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle."
27255,"I thank you. You're too kind. Glad you enjoyed it, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part, too."
27256,M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
27257,"I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared."
27258,"Well, I'm ready to punch in."
27259,"Nope, this was my own bright idea. C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos."
27260,"For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me."
27261,"Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie."
27262,Oh yeah? And where might that be? Oh.
27263,"Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me ""Baby Elephant Walk"" with a little reggae kinda beat?"
27264,"You wanted to see me, ""Tex""?"
27265,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick."
27266,Me? In the majors?
27267,"Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City ""Goofball""."
27268,I'll say!
27269,Because they might say no.
27270,This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
27271,I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. Oooh.
27272,It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.
27273,Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.
27274,You mean -- ?
27275,It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
27276,"That's right, Ned."
27277,"Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... not."
27278,"... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!"
27279,"With the fickle fans already forgetting me, I was ready to take the biggest step of my life."
27280,"Well kids, there it is, Capital City."
27281,Wow!
27282,"Kids, look! Street crime!"
27283,Wow! That's service!
27284,The Duff Brewery!
27285,"Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous."
27286,"We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did."
27287,"Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me."
27288,Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
27289,Wow.
27290,"Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City ""Goofball."""
27291,"Wow, the fifth."
27292,"Right, Mr. Goofball."
27293,"Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk."
27294,Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
27295,"Oooh, red hots."
27296,"Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. Uh oh."
27297,"I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'."
27298,But they didn't care.
27299,It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
27300,The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.
27301,What a family.
27302,My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
27303,"So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude."
27304,"Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention."
27305,Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
27306,Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.
27307,"H'lo, Flanders."
27308,Who told? Marge! Beer me!
27309,Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?
27310,"There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass."
27311,Marge! Where's the Duff?
27312,"Don't toy with me, woman."
27313,"Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break."
27314,Holy moly! It's... it's... beautiful!
27315,"Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years."
27316,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?"
27317,"Well, beggars can't be choosy."
27318,"All right, knock it off!"
27319,You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!
27320,I wouldn't stay on a bet!
27321,One for the road.
27322,"Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off..."
27323,"Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!"
27324,Well... he...
27325,No.
27326,"Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!"
27327,"Oh, he's perfect now, is he?"
27328,"No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way."
27329,I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.
27330,Flanders!
27331,Dear neighbor... 
27332,You are my brother. I love you and yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom.
27333,Wait! Wait! There's more...
27334,"""Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."""
27335,"Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"
27336,"Too bad we don't live on a farm. Let's go, boy."
27337,Fore!
27338,But I got it in the middle!
27339,"That was just a practice shot, boy."
27340,"I know, I know. I can still make this for five. Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze."
27341,Flanders! What are you doing here?
27342,That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.
27343,Luck.
27344,Never mind!
27345,"Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?"
27346,Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
27347,"Come on, boy."
27348,"Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose."
27349,"Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down."
27350,"No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. Keep your head down. Follow through..."
27351,"Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through."
27352,"What're you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your putter a name."
27353,"Come on, give it a name."
27354,"Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name."
27355,Your putter's name is Charlene!
27356,It just is. That's why.
27357,"Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him."
27358,I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!
27359,And?
27360,"But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses."
27361,Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
27362,I said NOW!
27363,Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --
27364,"Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt."
27365,"Ah, ""may the best man win"". The mating call of the loser."
27366,"Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?"
27367,That's right!
27368,"What, are you afraid to make a real bet?"
27369,"How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn."
27370,"Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress."
27371,"Read that back to me, Marge."
27372,Oh man. Fine.
27373,"I'm game if you are, Flanders."
27374,"Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate your shoulders..."
27375,"Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try."
27376,Anybody can try! I want you to win!
27377,"Marge, give me your honest opinion. This? Or this?"
27378,"Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!"
27379,"See you downstairs, boy."
27380,Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke...
27381,Oatmeal?
27382,"News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy."
27383,"Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win."
27384,"Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels."
27385,'Fraid not.
27386,'Fraid not.
27387,'Fraid not infinity.
27388,Woo-hoo-hoo!
27389,"Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: ""If you lose, you're out of the family."""
27390,Ow.
27391,"Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!"
27392,I got it right here in writing.
27393,The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
27394,It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.
27395,Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...
27396,"Halftime, Marge, halftime."
27397,Oh my God! He's enjoying it!
27398,Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!
27399,"Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!"
27400,Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
27401,Bullwinkle.
27402,Underdog! Don't you know anything?
27403,"Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce."
27404,"I know, I will."
27405,"See, Maggie? Those silver and blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys. They're Daddy's favorite team, and he wants them to lose by less than five and a half points. Understand?"
27406,"Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma."
27407,"Good to see ya. Well, gotta pick up my old man! 'Bye!"
27408,"Oh, I love those kids! They've got such a great attitude!"
27409,"Come on, Dad. Let's get outta here."
27410,This place is depressing.
27411,"Oh, well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. Let's go."
27412,This thing's gonna be roaring any time now!
27413,The hell with this.
27414,Holy moly! That's the biggest... one of those I ever saw.
27415,"Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!"
27416,"All right, Bart that's it! Go to your room NOW!"
27417,"...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?"
27418,"Don't worry, Marge'll fix everything."
27419,"Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Little Helper. Come on... gimme that. Gimme that."
27420,"Okay, out you go!"
27421,"Yes, Dad."
27422,"You know, his girlfriend is the weather lady."
27423,What show is this?
27424,"Hello, operator? Gimme the number for 911!"
27425,Will you forget the report! He's down at the rescue mission!
27426,"Well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister."
27427,"We can, and will!"
27428,"Marge, are we ever gonna see him again?"
27429,"Oh it's great to have you back, boy! We were afraid we'd lost you!"
27430,"Yeah, boy. Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness."
27431,It's your fault I'm bald!
27432,"Damn, no spots."
27433,"You know Marge, we're great parents!"
27434,"Oh Lord, on this blessed day, we thank thee for giving our family one more crack at togetherness. Amen."
27435,"Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor's got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match."
27436,"Hey, I don't see your name engraved on the bar stool."
27437,Whoa.
27438,TRUCKASAUROUS!
27439,"I have an announcement to make. As a family growth thing, Bart and I think we should all go to the Monster Truck Rally this Saturday."
27440,"Uh... Monster Truck Rally, growth thing... No, I don't think so."
27441,"Oh, cruel fate. Why do you mock me?"
27442,"Eight o'clock, but what does it matter?"
27443,"Marge, you're a genius."
27444,Series?!
27445,"Oh, good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long."
27446,That was beautiful. Can we go now?
27447,How much longer was Sherbert planning on making this piece of junk?
27448,"Thanks, Flanders. Big know-it-all."
27449,"Come on, Flanders, he's not that bad."
27450,Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
27451,"Not now, Lisa."
27452,What?
27453,"Where, where?"
27454,"Let the destruction begin! Hey, they forgot my corn dog."
27455,"Here you go, Bartasaurous."
27456,Oh I can't watch.
27457,"Bart, Bart. We're home, son."
27458,Kids say such stupid things.
27459,"Come on Marge, we're mad at 'im."
27460,Ewwww.
27461,"Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?"
27462,"Oh, hi, kids. Thanks."
27463,"You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it."
27464,Springfield Gorge? I thought we settled this daredevil junk.
27465,"I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all."
27466,"He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead."
27467,"Oh, that never works. He's a goner."
27468,"Okay, okay. I'll try."
27469,Bart? Bart?
27470,Bart! What are you doing?
27471,"You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?"
27472,"Look, I know I can't stop you. The only thing I can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge."
27473,"'Cause if you don't, I'll never believe anything you say, ever again."
27474,"I mean it, boy."
27475,That's my boy.
27476,"You know, Marge, we got a pretty good kid there."
27477,"Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old --"
27478,Why that little liar! I should... and I was gonna play pickle with him.
27479,BART!
27480,"Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself."
27481,Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
27482,Don't you think I know that?
27483,"Goodbye, son."
27484,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."
27485,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --"
27486,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
27487,"You think you've got guts, try raising my kids."
27488,"You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world."
27489,"Marge, I'm gonna build you a spice rack!"
27490,It's no trouble. I've got a whole garageful of tools I never use.
27491,"Shut up, boy."
27492,"I knew all this stuff would come in handy some day. Let's see now... ah, here it is. The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf. Volume One. Spice Rack."
27493,Pick - up - a - ham - mer...
27494,Wowww....
27495,"No, I can't. It's broken."
27496,"Keep her away from me, Marge! She's got that crazy look in her eyes again."
27497,"You heard me. I won't be in for the rest of the week. I told you. My baby beat me up. Oh, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. Wise guy."
27498,"Hey, how come you can watch cartoons but the kids can't?"
27499,Because why?
27500,"Because you said so, why?"
27501,Oh. What are you doing?
27502,"Heh, heh, heh."
27503,"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
27504,No.
27505,"Everybody's looking at us, Marge."
27506,"Oh. Well, how long are we going to have to be doing this?"
27507,I didn't know they still made TV dinners this bad.
27508,There's peas in my fruit cobbler.
27509,"Hey, tomorrow night, how about making some of your patented pork chops?"
27510,Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.
27511,"You know, some of these stories are pretty good. I never know mice lived such interesting lives."
27512,Take that you dumb squirrel.
27513,Where do they get their ideas?
27514,One thousand dollars.
27515,"Oh, sorry."
27516,I was watching that.
27517,"... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie."
27518,"Sit down, boy!"
27519,"Wow. What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge. And the parents of Springfield owe it all to you."
27520,"Well, I always knew you'd change the world, for the better."
27521,"Marge, get the door."
27522,Really? Great!
27523,"Well, there he is... Michelangelo's Dave."
27524,"Oh. What's wrong, Marge?"
27525,"Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing."
27526,They're forcing 'em.
27527,He's awake!
27528,"Hey, yeah! Who are you? I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance..."
27529,"Ooo, classy."
27530,"Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious."
27531,Wow...
27532,"Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office right now and..."
27533,Uh-oh...
27534,"Nice to meet you too, sir."
27535,A hundred bucks?
27536,"W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone..."
27537,"You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself out."
27538,Hey! Lionel Hutz...
27539,"You sure have got some education, Mr. Hutz."
27540,Fifty percent?
27541,Well... I dunno... You and I might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.
27542,Whoo ooo! I stand corrected. A million bucks is A-okay!
27543,Whiplash! Oh no!
27544,"Yes, son."
27545,"No, of course you're not going to die. Everything's fine!"
27546,No!
27547,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert from Johns Hopkins Medical School?"
27548,Just give me a ticket.
27549,"Oh, what? What is it?"
27550,Don't mind if I do.
27551,"Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?"
27552,You mean duke it out?
27553,Five hundred thousand dollars!
27554,"Well, Marge, what do you think?"
27555,I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
27556,Five hundred thousand dollars. I spit on his five hundred thousand dollars.
27557,"Oh, the truth!"
27558,Will that hold up in court?
27559,"Oh, Marge."
27560,A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.
27561,"Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. No, thank you."
27562,"No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. No, thank you."
27563,"No, thank you."
27564,"Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?"
27565,I don't know if I'll ever come back here. Goodnight.
27566,"Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in."
27567,"Moe, I wish he'd shut up."
27568,"Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife."
27569,"Oh, Marge..."
27570,"No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
27571,"I'm saying... She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. I'm not sure I love you anymore."
27572,But don't worry. I'll never let on. I'll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.
27573,"Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her."
27574,"Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever."
27575,"Sorry to scare you like that, babe."
27576,Is it done yet? Is it done yet?
27577,"Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four, three, two, one, ping!"
27578,We have meatloaf!
27579,"Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa."
27580,What are you getting at?
27581,What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.
27582,"Shut up, boy."
27583,"Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87."
27584,"Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?"
27585,Fine. We'll go to Mars.
27586,No!
27587,"If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?"
27588,"Oh, try me."
27589,No.
27590,No.
27591,No!
27592,No!
27593,No!
27594,"Oh, okay, okay!"
27595,"Oh, okay. HELLO!"
27596,"It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those."
27597,Good thing I'm open-minded.
27598,Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.
27599,"I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one."
27600,"Oh boy, this fish is dee-lish!"
27601,"... oh, oh, and two of these things."
27602,"And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe..."
27603,You're the doctor!
27604,There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!
27605,"Come on, pal! Fugu me!"
27606,I want fugu!
27607,Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.
27608,"Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?"
27609,"Oh, I couldn't possibly."
27610,Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!
27611,"""Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer?"" I never heard of a poison pork chop."
27612,"No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book."
27613,"Oooh! It's good news, isn't it?"
27614,Twenty-four hours?
27615,"Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die."
27616,No way! Because I'm not dying.
27617,Why you little --
27618,What's after fear? What's after fear?
27619,"Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while."
27620,"Well, we all gotta go some time."
27621,"Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
27622,So you're going to die... 
27623,"Hello, Marge? Hello? I'm the one who's dying, not you."
27624,Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
27625,Almost.
27626,"I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know..."
27627,Be intimate with Marge.
27628,"Ah, watch the sunrise."
27629,"Till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth."
27630,"Eleven-thirty! Oh, that's just great."
27631,"Marge, why did you let me sleep so late?"
27632,There'll be plenty of time for that! I've got tons of important stuff to do.
27633,Bart! Bart!
27634,Have man-to-man with Bart.
27635,"Come here, boy."
27636,"Nooo, I just want to have a heart-to-heart talk."
27637,"You know, Bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --"
27638,"Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, ""cover for me."" Number two, ""oh, good idea, boss."" Number three, ""it was like that when I got here."""
27639,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
27640,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
27641,"Oh, Why you little --"
27642,"Oh, that's my boy."
27643,Listen to Lisa play her sax.
27644,No. Let me hear you play.
27645,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?"
27646,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE... OVER THERE."""
27647,"Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it?"
27648,"Hey, Flanders, could I borrow your camcorder?"
27649,"No, thanks."
27650,"No, I don't want-a..."
27651,"Flanders, I said I didn't -- Tomorrow? Sure, what the hey. I'd love to come to your barbecue. I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest T-bones you've ever seen."
27652,"Heh-heh. The joke's on him, I'll be dead by then."
27653,"I'm sorry, Officer. I know I was going too fast. Just give me a ticket."
27654,"This is a videotape for my daughter, Maggie. Hi, Maggie. I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. Oooooooh. Hope that didn't scare you. Well, you're a grown-up now, and unless you've taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man your father was... He was a simple man. A kind man. A gentle man who loved his children and..."
27655,Hello? Yeah he's here who is this? Bart's friend Milhouse. Bart! Get your butt down here!
27656,Dad --
27657,"Dad, we've never been too close, have we?"
27658,"Never went fishing, or played catch, or even hugged each other."
27659,"I just want you to know that I love you, Dad."
27660,Huh uh.
27661,Dad!
27662,Papa!
27663,"My old man. Well, I gotta go."
27664,"Well, gee, Dad, if I wasn't on such a tight schedule--"
27665,"Well, I ... Oh, let's get some worms."
27666,"Well, no time for that."
27667,"Oh, I really wanted to do that one."
27668,"Gee, Dad. Way to hog my last moments."
27669,"Yeah, yeah. The old guy's a little love-starved."
27670,"Get moving, you hunk of junk. I gotta make up for lost time."
27671,"I pay my taxes and they pay your salary, so when I say ""give me a ticket"", just give me a ticket."
27672,That's sorta nice. What are you in for?
27673,Wait! I can't call Marge. It's our last day on earth together. I can't drag her into this mess. I know! I'll call Barney.
27674,Damn those novelty telephone answering machine tapes!
27675,"Thanks a lot, Barney. I just wasted my one phone call on your stupid ma--"
27676,"You gotta help me, Barney. I'm in jail."
27677,Ju... ju....just get over here and bring fifty bucks for bail.
27678,"Hey, Barney, look. It was on my list, along with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today. Hey, my boss!"
27679,"Hey, Burns! Eat my shorts!"
27680,Wow! Of all the luck! To think I almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.
27681,I gotta call Marge.
27682,"Oh, it was busy. Moe, another last beer, please."
27683,"Guys, keep it down. I got some last words. I never told you this before, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that ... oh, words won't do it. I love you, Moe."
27684,"I love you, Barney."
27685,"Come on, Barney, I gotta get home."
27686,"Faster, Barney, faster."
27687,"Oh, I can't wait any longer. Hold on, Marge. I'm comin' home, baby."
27688,Marge! Marge!
27689,There's no time to explain.
27690,Love you. Love you. Love you.
27691,"Okay, okay."
27692,"Oh, gimme a break, Marge."
27693,That was beautiful.
27694,"Goodbye, Maggie -- stay as sweet as you are."
27695,"Goodbye, Lisa -- I know you'll make me proud."
27696,"Goodbye, Bart -- I like your sheets."
27697,The Good Book...
27698, ... on tape... 
27699,"""Oooo, as read by Larry King."""
27700,All right. Stop it! Cut it out!
27701,What are you talking about?
27702,"I'm alive! I'm alive. And I couldn't be happier. From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!"
27703,"Do you two have to sit so close to the TV? Back up, or it'll hurt your eyes."
27704,Oh yes it will.
27705,That makes two of us.
27706,I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
27707,"All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery."
27708,"Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?"
27709,How's this?
27710,"Okay, just everybody remain calm."
27711,"Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can."
27712,She's right! She's right!
27713,"Oh, how I miss TV! Dear, God. Just give me one channel!"
27714,Bart!
27715,"Ugh, gross. Ecch."
27716,SOME PEOPLE CALL ME A SPACE COWBOY / YEAH / SOME CALL ME THE GANGSTER OF LOVE / SOME PEOPLE CALL ME MAURICE. Woo woo / 'CAUSE I SPEAK OF THE PUPPETS OH OF LOVE.
27717,"English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England. Come on, let's go smoke."
27718,But we're early for lunch. Let's go grab a burger.
27719,"Eh, it's my metabmobolism. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones."
27720,"Hey, don't worry Barney. It's a big school. There's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom."
27721,I... I don't know!
27722,She's mine!
27723,"So, what are you in for?"
27724,"Well, I'm here for being me. Every day I show up, act like me, and they slap me in here."
27725,I haven't seen you in school before.
27726,What?
27727,Maybe we should get together some time.
27728,I'm Homer.
27729,J.
27730,Simpson.
27731,It was worth it.
27732,"I'd reached step one: She knew I existed. The only problem was, she didn't care."
27733,Nothing.
27734,"Dad, I'm in love."
27735,"But, Dad, I don't drink..."
27736,Uh-huh.
27737,"Oh, yeah."
27738,"Thanks, Pop."
27739,"Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I need some guidance, counselor."
27740,"Well, yeah, maybe, but I just met this girl, Marge Bouvier and I want to force her to like me."
27741,Oh.
27742,"Well, what interest does she have that I could make common?"
27743,Far out!
27744,Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night.
27745,"Me, in a nuclear power plant... Kaboom!"
27746,My name's Homer Simpson. I'd like to sign up for something.
27747,"Debate? Like, arguing?"
27748,"I'll take that, you stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein."
27749,"Fifty-five! That's ridiculous! Sure, they'll save a few lives. But millions will be late!"
27750,No Way.
27751,Ignoramus.
27752,Wait a minute! That word you keep calling me --
27753,Ignoramus. It means I'm stupid! Doesn't it?
27754,Not to me there isn't!
27755,You ignoramus.
27756,"No, you..."
27757,With pleasure.
27758,Hel-lo.
27759,"Oh, you may not remember me. I'm Homer Simpson. I mooned for rebuttal."
27760,So... you wanna go out with me?
27761,"Well, a... You see the problem is, you don't know me. I have references. Just ask Coach Flanagan, and ask Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumbel."
27762,"Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where I can touch your goodies, I'm just asking you to be fair."
27763,"Well, what's the good word?"
27764,What?
27765,I'm... a spare. Excuse me.
27766,What?
27767,"Yeah, so...."
27768,You tutor?
27769,And anyone can be tooted?
27770,French. What a coincidence. Just the subject I'm having trouble with.
27771,"Bart, pay attention. You may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks."
27772,"Ooh, lost a few. Oh, well there's plenty more where that came from. Uh-oh, a zit. No problemo."
27773,The perfect crime.
27774,Hel - lo.
27775,It helps me study. Heh-heh-heh.
27776,Cray-on.
27777,Fenetre.
27778,Femme.
27779,"Oh.... wait, Don't go. Don't go. Wait, wait -- why don't we take a little study break?"
27780,Do the hustle!
27781,ALLOUETTE JAUNTE ALLOUETTE / ALLOUETTE JAUNTE...
27782,"I can't believe it, it's sticking. You're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! And it's all thanks to you. Marge, when I see you forming the vowels and continents --"
27783,#NAME?
27784,"Marge, would you go to the prom with me?"
27785,"I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? Please say oui."
27786,"Ohhh! oh, Marge! This'll be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm gonna spend it all on us. I'm renting the biggest limo. I'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw."
27787,"Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better."
27788,Ow.
27789,"Hey, Barney, guess whose got a date for the prom?"
27790,Is Marge here?
27791,I'm her date.
27792,"Oh, okay."
27793,"Thanks, Mr. B."
27794,You said you'd go to the prom with me.
27795,"I was afraid you'd cancel our date so I stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... I hope."
27796,She's with him.
27797,"Hey, I paid for this car. I paid for this tuxedo and I paid for the two dinners. We're going to the prom."
27798,"You wish, Dondelinger."
27799,"One of each, please."
27800,Barney!
27801,"Oh, isn't she great? Hail Queen Marge! Woo woo! Long live the Queen!"
27802,I gotta get outta here.
27803,What?
27804,"Because I'm sure we were meant to be together. Usually when I have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. Something says yes, something says no. But this time there's only yes. How could the only thing I've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?"
27805,Inspiration Point.
27806,"Naw, that's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk home."
27807,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
27808,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!"
27809,Marge?
27810,Sure.
27811,Who? Oh.
27812,"Marge, pour vous."
27813,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go."
27814,And I never have.
27815,"Hey, good evening, Hezron, Carver of Graven Images."
27816,"Been a little slow these past few months. Not much to steal in the desert, you know."
27817,"Heh, heh, heh, heh."
27818,"Ah, good evening, Zohar the Adulterer. My wife sends her warmest regards."
27819,"Thank you, my lusty friend."
27820,"Quick, everybody look busy."
27821,"Hey, Moses, keep 'em comin'."
27822,Huh?
27823,"Hey, Flanders. Who put that bug up your butt?"
27824,"Boy, what's this world coming to?"
27825,Gotta go.
27826,"Hey, stop, cable man! Stop!"
27827,I want free cable.
27828,"So this is okay, I mean everybody does it, right?"
27829,So You've Decided To Steal Cable.
27830,"""Myth: Cable piracy is wrong. Fact: Cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."""
27831,Cable. It's more wonderful than I dared hope.
27832,It's funny 'cause it's true!
27833,"Oh, hey, hey. Family, family, come here. I have an announcement to make. The Simpsons have cable."
27834,That's right. Sixty-eight channels. MTV for the kids. VH-1 for us. Sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!
27835,"Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that."
27836,"Don't worry, Marge. Take a look at this."
27837,Marge --
27838,Hear Me Roar -- The Network For Women.
27839,"Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport."
27840,They must think people will watch anything.
27841,"Huh, wha'? Oh, okay."
27842,Oooh. Pizza.
27843,Bart!
27844,The lad has a point.
27845,"Read the pamphlet, honey."
27846,"Oh, goody! A program-length advertisements!"
27847,Bart!
27848,"Oh, great... All right, what makes you say that?"
27849,"Well, duh."
27850,"Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?"
27851,And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
27852,"Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds."
27853,"Well, thank you honey."
27854,Whooo!
27855,"Oh, boy!"
27856,How can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness?
27857,"We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV."
27858,"Pass the pumice, please."
27859,"Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all."
27860,"Yeah, Friday night. You want to come over?"
27861,"Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight."
27862,Bart!
27863,"Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again."
27864,Promise me.
27865,Good boy.
27866,Hey Lisa -- Racing from Belmont? Horsies!
27867,"There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium."
27868,Unhook it?! But I love cable.
27869,"Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to."
27870,"Marge, I never put my foot down about anything."
27871,...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
27872,"Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down."
27873,"It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken."
27874,Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. Seen it.
27875,"Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?"
27876,Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.
27877,He's not home.
27878,"Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff."
27879,Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
27880,"Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room."
27881,Oh great.
27882,Just a select circle of my friends.
27883,"Oh, didja swipe those from work?"
27884,"Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs..."
27885,"All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!."
27886,"Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these."
27887,"Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I ""borrowed"" from work."
27888,"All right, the stuff I stole from work!"
27889,"Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet."
27890,Will you quit staring at me like that!
27891,"Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?"
27892,Yeah.
27893,"No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never..."
27894,"Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest."
27895,"Oh, no."
27896,"Marge, Lisa, Maggie..."
27897,"Come on, boy."
27898,"Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you."
27899,"Yeah, at the worst possible time."
27900,The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
27901,"Cable clippers, please."
27902,Oops.
27903,Third time's the charm.
27904,Ooh! Barbecue!
27905,This is like some beautiful dream.
27906,"Marge, honey, I've got five words to say to you. Greasy Joe's Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit."
27907,"Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times."
27908,I'll take that bet.
27909,"I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me."
27910,"Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law."
27911,Remember? Who could forget?
27912,But that was just an idle promise.
27913,Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
27914,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched."
27915,But Marge...
27916,All right.
27917,Okay.
27918,Hey! Why should she have a better husband than you do?
27919,Must find man. Must find man. Must find man.
27920,"Boy, a good man really is hard to find."
27921,"One seafood burrito, Apu."
27922,Sorry.
27923,What is it this time?
27924,"But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?"
27925,"But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?"
27926,"Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school."
27927,Excellent.
27928,"Heh heh heh. Here we go. Boy meets beast. Principal Skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, Selma."
27929,Wha...?
27930,"Oh yes, plenty of fish. We just don't have any bait."
27931,"Ah, Moe. I've gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma."
27932,Like my wife's ugly sister.
27933,"Hey, Selma's no prize pig herself you know."
27934,"But' nothing, Marge. She's a heifer, plain and simple."
27935,"Oh, there's the little prom queen now."
27936,Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!
27937,"Take it to the hoop, Selma."
27938,"... And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. Amen."
27939,"Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college."
27940,Not one word.
27941,I thought I said knock it off!
27942,"Well, no panta-ma-mime, either."
27943,The hospital? Y'ello... Oh my God!
27944,"What is it, Da --"
27945,"Oh Dad, you and your imagination."
27946,A half-brother?
27947,"This makes me feel special, Dad. Since I'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me."
27948,"I'm going to find my brother. I don't care what it takes. If I have to move heaven and earth, I'm going to find him!"
27949,Bart!
27950,I guess he's got us there.
27951,Bart!
27952,Twen... forty-eight. This is it.
27953,"Excuse me, is this an orphanage?"
27954,"Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed to walk through this life alone. Oh brother, where art thou?!"
27955,"Oh. Hee, hee. Sorry."
27956,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I wish I could help you but we're looking for my brother today. Can you tell me his name?"
27957,Herbert. Herbert Powell. Great! Where can I find him?
27958,"Oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. Please..."
27959,"I know, he could be anywhere! That's why I want you to narrow it down! Please..."
27960,"Well, if you ask me, changing the subject makes you the most worthless, heartless, excuse for a human being I ever..."
27961,"Oh, oh... I get it. Okay. Here's twenty bucks. Now will you tell me where my brother lives?"
27962,Just take it and tell me!
27963,Fine. Thank you.
27964,"Let's see, Powell, Powell... Powell... Pomerant, Poole, Popkin, Potter, Quigley, Quimby, Randolph... whoops, too far. Here it is, Powell."
27965,"No, I've called all three Herbert Powells in Detroit. Nothing."
27966,"H! Of course. That could stand for Herbert! It's a long shot, but..."
27967,"Hello, is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan?"
27968,By any chance does the H stand for Herbert?
27969,"Woo woo! The H stands for Herbert! Herb, were you adopted?"
27970,From the Shelbyville Orphanage?
27971,"Because... ... I'm your baby brother, Homer!"
27972,Hello? Hello? Hello? Stupid phone!
27973,"Oh, sorry."
27974,"Okay, Brother! Grab the next plane to Springfield. We got a couch that folds out..."
27975,Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further. Just a little further.
27976,"But Marge, I want to see my brother--"
27977,Oh.
27978,"That's okay, carry on. See the way I handled that, Marge?"
27979,What does it look like?
27980,"Marge, this can't be the right address."
27981,Hello in there.
27982,Herb?
27983,Holy moly! The bastard's rich!
27984,"Herb, allow me to introduce my family. This is my wife, Marge..."
27985,"... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie."
27986,"Yeah, though the boy was a close call."
27987,What's to know? Just dive in. Catch!
27988,I feel the same about you.
27989,Even pork chops?
27990,"You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?"
27991,"Wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got this straight... It's Christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach..."
27992,Will you kids shut up?
27993,"Okay, we're watching."
27994,"Hello, Cook? Sorry to bother you so late, but I got a hankerin' for some... that's right... don't forget the apple sauce!"
27995,Are you sure you want to give me a car?
27996,"Oh, okay. I'd like a big one, then."
27997,Why not?
27998,"Well, then give me one with lots of pep."
27999,America.
28000,You do.
28001,And I want to let you!!
28002,"Hi'ya, team."
28003,I dunno.
28004,What's that?
28005,"All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?"
28006,"Oh yeah, he did!"
28007,"Oh, okay."
28008,"Ugh, oh boy."
28009,Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...
28010,Huh?
28011,"Uh, yeah, I think I did."
28012,"Uh, may I be excused, please?"
28013,Because you think I'm a genius?
28014,Because you think I'm dynamic?
28015,You think I work well with others?
28016,"Oh, great."
28017,"Ah, Unky Herb, I don't know anything about cars."
28018,Sort of.
28019,What?
28020,Sort of!
28021,All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!
28022,Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? The cup is this big!
28023,And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
28024,And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!
28025,"I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play ""La Cucaracha."""
28026,"And sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. There's got to be something you can do about that."
28027,You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?
28028,"Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!"
28029,No! No! No! No! No!
28030,"All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way."
28031,"Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it."
28032,"Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life."
28033,Ooo.
28034,"Get in, Dad. I'll explain on the way home."
28035,"What is it, boy?"
28036,"Thanks, boy. I was waiting for someone to say that."
28037,"No! No! No! Bad dog! Let go! Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop it! No, not the sports section! No!"
28038,Stupid dog.
28039,No! Stay away! This is not for you! This is Homer food.
28040,"Marge, the dog is hungry!"
28041,"Yes, Master."
28042,Y'ello.
28043,"Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard."
28044,"Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right --"
28045,"Hey Lenny, I need to leave early. Cover for me, will ya?"
28046,"Well, well. Mr. Universe takes a walk. Haw, haw!"
28047,"Look at that get-up. Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... Assassins!"
28048,Oooh! Oooh! How much? How much? How much?
28049,Yeah.
28050,"Y'ello, Hi, Lisa, what's wrong? The mumps? Oooh, the kissing disease! My little girl is growing up."
28051,"So what does my little girl want? What? Let me write this down. Copies of ""Teen Dream... Teen Scream... and Teen Steam Magazine."" Well, okay. You're the sickie. Goodbye, Lisa."
28052,"Oh man, two dollars. Uh, I'll take these three... They're for my daughter."
28053,Assassins!
28054,"Oh, a hundred and twenty-five bucks!"
28055,But I can't afford to...
28056,"Okay, Flanders, you're the boss. Heh, heh, heh."
28057,Here's your magazines. How many of these guys are named Corey?
28058,"Yep! Hee, hee. Read 'em and weep."
28059,Bart!
28060,"Well, you bought all those smoke alarms and we haven't had a single fire."
28061,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
28062,I've changed my mind. I decided I don't want these shoes.
28063,"Well, my faithful dog was bringing me my shoes and they fell apart in his mouth."
28064,Big cookie.
28065,"Well, aloha!"
28066,The price is right.
28067,Mmmm. Macamadamia nuts.
28068,"Oh, so that's your little plan! Get us addicted, then jack up the price! Well, you win."
28069,Property of Hom-er J. Simp-son. Hands off.
28070,"Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to..."
28071,"No, MY COOKIE!"
28072,This is not happening! This is not happening!
28073,Everybody in the kitchen! We're having a family meeting!
28074,We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
28075,I'm saying...
28076,Bart!
28077,"You do? Ha ha, ha ha ha!"
28078,No.
28079,"Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey."
28080,"No, we have to commit ourselves. Now take this down. ""Free to loving home. World's most brilliant dog. Says 'I love you' on command."""
28081,Type! Type!
28082,"Oh no, we'd never give him away, but, we're moving to another country where dogs are forbidden. Hear what? Oh, sure. C'mere, boy! Put that prowler down. Come here! Come on boy! Say it, boy! Say ""I love you"" for the nice man! I lub you. Good dog! Good doggie! Isn't that amazing? See you soon. Woooo! Wooo!"
28083,"Uh, you can pick him up tomorrow."
28084,"Dad, the next time we see you we'll do something more fun."
28085,"Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital."
28086,"My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?"
28087,"Marge, what do we do?"
28088,"Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?"
28089,No.
28090,He can't ride ponies.
28091,"Oh, we saw that."
28092,"No, Bart. No!"
28093,I got it. The Springfield Mystery Spot.
28094,Dad! It's the third Sunday of the month. You know what that means.
28095,"Oh, come on, Dad, I promise we'll have more fun this time. We're gonna see lions."
28096,"Oh, you have a girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh."
28097,"Well, Happy Birthday, Bea. She can come with us. Hey, there's room for all your friends in the car."
28098,"Yeah, right."
28099,"Hey you kids, stop kicking the seat!"
28100,"Well, let 'em sleep on their own time!"
28101,"Bart, get out and push."
28102,"I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad."
28103,Oh no! Dad's lost his hearing.
28104,Yell-o.
28105,Whoo-hoo. It's Dad. Dad's on the phone. He's calling me.
28106,"Oh Dad. Oh, I knew you'd forgive me."
28107,I miss my Daddy.
28108,Huh?
28109,Dad!
28110,"Well... sure. We'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. Bart!"
28111,"Pass the bug juice, Dad."
28112,"Bart! Forgive him, Dad. He's just a stupid little kid who says the first thing that pops into his head. But, you know, there's wisdom in his innocence."
28113,"Yes, I do."
28114,"Miss, I'm looking for Abe Simpson."
28115,It's important I get a hold of him. I have to tell him I don't care about his money and I love him.
28116,Casino?
28117,"A double cheese burger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and for God's sakes, hurry!"
28118,"Excuse me. Excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? He looks like me, but he's wrinkled? Hello, have you seen a..."
28119,Dad! Noooooooooo!
28120,Holy Moly! You're winning!
28121,"Dad! Please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. You understand that, take all your money and leave now."
28122,But you could lose everything. Come on.
28123,You'll be a bonehead. Come on.
28124,"Dad, no! Gimme that."
28125,Gimme me that money. Ow! You're hurting me.
28126,"So, have you figured out who gets the money?"
28127,"If I take you, will you two SHUT UP AND QUIT BUGGING ME?"
28128,YES!!!
28129,"Heads up, kids. I'm moving the seat back."
28130,"All right, everybody stick together. We don't want to get separated..."
28131,The hell with this.
28132,"Slide inspector comin' through! Please move to the right. Grab that handrail, young man. Outta my way, I'm here for your safety."
28133,Oh no! Urg... Arrrgh. C'mon you stupid tube!!!
28134,OH NOOOOOO!!!!
28135,I... can't... breathe! Too... many... children...!
28136,"All right family, I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight?"
28137,"Well, am I?"
28138,"Four Hundred and thirty-seven. Fifty-five. Oh my God, three hundred and... Hey, a hundred and fifty. Oh God, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big fat pig."
28139,"Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone."
28140,"But I'm going on a diet. From this day forward I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty, no pizza too laden with delicious toppings, to prevent me from reaching my scientifically determined ideal weight! As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again!"
28141,"Oh, shut up."
28142,"This old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. I said, isn't it, boy?"
28143,Don't you ever do that to me again.
28144,Bart!
28145,Get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.
28146,"Ooh, the Glutimus Maximizer."
28147,"Don't you know anything, boy? That's Ringo Starr."
28148,"Your mother must have painted this. I guess she thought he was cute... Hey, what the..."
28149,Marge!
28150,Likely story.
28151,"Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?"
28152,"Well, wait a minute. Hey, I've been setting my drinks on these things."
28153,Hello? Hello? Hello taste... where are you?
28154,"Hey, hey, now you're talkin'!"
28155,Do I have to do anything?
28156,"Great, fine, go nuts!"
28157,"Mmm, only thirty-five calories."
28158,"I can't move, boy."
28159,"Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! ""Last Supper"", eat your heart out!"
28160,Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!
28161,"Marge, Marge. Look at me! My clothes are just hanging off me!"
28162,What a family.
28163,"Honey, I'm home!"
28164,"Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. Marge, may I see you in the other room?"
28165,"Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please..."
28166,"All right, all right, who took the funny pages?"
28167,"All right, scale. You don't like me and I don't like you, but I've been very good, so you better treat me right."
28168,All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
28169,Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and I'm feeling fine! Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
28170,"If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator."
28171,No. Burns is right. What's the use?
28172,Marge.
28173,"Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow."
28174,"What?! Marge, you have to."
28175,"Hello, what's this?"
28176,"It's for you, Marge. From merry old England."
28177,"Come on, Marge. Paint. I think you can do it."
28178,A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!
28179,Wow! You made the front page.
28180,"Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?"
28181,"Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?"
28182,"Now, go get 'em."
28183,The Museum!
28184,"Tomorrow... ugh; oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching T.V... spending some time with the boy. Spending time with the boy. The boy needs attention, Marge."
28185,"Shut up, boy."
28186,"Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. Lousy brain."
28187,"Hey, what do you mean by, ""Suggested Donation""?"
28188,"And what if I ""wish"" to pay zero?"
28189,"Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?"
28190,"I see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady! You're gonna need it!"
28191,Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!
28192,"Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man."
28193,She said that?
28194,"But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, ""Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- """
28195,"Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A."
28196,Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.
28197,You are smooth. I'll give you that.
